  <title>About database: What about crowdsourcing and fetching from kicad-libs?</title>
  <description>Hello.

I'm an electronics student and found your app really interesting. Finding data sheets is a pain in the ass.
 Thanks a lot for rescuing the project.

Are you thinking about advanced taxonomy and local caching? What about alternative sources? KiCad libraries provide links to datasheets, for example.

My pipe dream would be a C++ multiplatform datasheet manager and finder with crowdsourced but reviewed info. And modularize it to use it as library on FOSS EDA tools such as gEDA and KiCad. Or name it LGPL so even smaller proprietary EDA could use it too.

The next one would be GFDL computer and human readable datasheets+spice/Verilog-A models.

This is nonsense and difficult to do, I'm just dreaming...
