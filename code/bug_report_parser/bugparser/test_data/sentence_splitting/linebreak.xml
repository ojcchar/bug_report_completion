to reproduce:
step1. Go to a (sub-)account
step2. Create a new transaction (click the big Plus sign for example)

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open a new tab or reuse an existing tab.
2. Begin typing a URL in the location bar so at least one autocomplete entry is
displayed in a dropdown.
3. Use tab or arrow keys to highlight an autocomplete entry. It appears in the
location bar.
4. Click in the location bar and change the URL to something not in the
autocomplete list (the change, it appears, needs to be after the last / in the
URL, so as not to start up autocomplete again), then hit enter.

This is a test, building
a great thing.

```
A top-level ant build file would be nice that loads properties from a file.

This build fild should also support the target "install" to install all 
apk files at once on the emulator.

Another target, "release" could produce all release zip files (source, 
binary, and javadoc).

```

Steps to reproduce (test files are attached):

(1) test1.doc was created with MS Word 2003 SP3 using the default
normal.dot template. Check the list of all styles (including the
character styles) in the document.

(2) In Writer open test1.doc. In the list of paragraph and character
styles there are some new character styles with odd names:
WW8Num10z0, WW8Num5z0, WW8Num6z0, WW8Num7z0, WW8Num8z0.
Save the document as test2.doc and exit.

(3) In Writer open test2.doc. In the list of paragraph and character
styles there is a new character style: Absatz-Standardschriftart.
Save the document as test3.doc and exit.

Reproducing steps
1 Create a site config file test in /etc/apache2/sites-available by using 
following command:
echo Listen 1234 > test
2 Enable site test and reload
3 Disable site test and reload
After this reloading, apache will use up all memory and finally be killed by 
linux kernel.
There are 2G memory in my server!
