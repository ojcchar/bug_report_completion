  <title>Downloaded PDFs are corrupted; alldatasheets blocked you?</title>

  2.a. check that in the database, everything seems ok; double-clicking the table you just created gives you:
  
  When I try to view any datasheet (ex. attiny85), I get an "cannot open PDF file" from my pdf reader. The contents of the pdf downloaded to `/sdcard/ATtiny85-20140111-230016.pdf` are:


This is a test about the file extensions file.java  `/sdcard/ATtiny85-20140111-230016.pdf` are: file.txt file.cpp file.php  230016.php
