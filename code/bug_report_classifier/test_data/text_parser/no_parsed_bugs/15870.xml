    <title>mod_disk_cache: caching responses to no-store requests</title>
    <description>Looks like a possible RFC 2616 MUST violation.

cache-control directive. The bug is submitted 
with elevated severity level because the violation
might affect end-user privacy.

See attached trace for details and ways to reproduce
the violation.
