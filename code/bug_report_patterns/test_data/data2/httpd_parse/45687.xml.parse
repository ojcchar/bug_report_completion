            <sentence id="9.1">The underlying cause is mod_charset_lite not treating metadata buckets
specially.</sentence>

code is communicated by adding an error bucket to the brigade.</sentence>
            <sentence id="9.3">When it gets to
mod_charset_lite, the module reads the data from it (none) and discards it;
thus the error code never gets to the end of the filter chain and is not sent
back to the client.</sentence>
