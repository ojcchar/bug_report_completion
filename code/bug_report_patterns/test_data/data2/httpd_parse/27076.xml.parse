    <title>util_ldap.c could loop over multiple entries</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The existing util_ldap.c considers it an error in util_ldap_cache_checkuserid 
if it searches for a user and gets back more than one entry.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">It could instead 
loop on the variable 'entry', using both ldap_first_entry and ldap_next_entry, 
to try binding to each entry in turn.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">I've made the change, and it seems to 
work fine - is there any particular problem with doing this?</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">(I'm ignoring the question of whether there *should* be non-unique entries in a 
directory server - I have to deal with a directory server that has them, 
whether I like it or not :-)</sentence>
