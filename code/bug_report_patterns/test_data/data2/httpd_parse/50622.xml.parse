        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The documentation for mod_cgi at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_cgi.html still refers to the CGI specification which was hosted at hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">That hostname no longer resolves, so presumably this should be changed to refer to the CGI RFC 3875.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">See also bugs #47455 and #49152.</sentence>
