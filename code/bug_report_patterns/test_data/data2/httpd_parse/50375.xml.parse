            <sentence id="2.1">While &lt;Directory /foo&gt; exactly describes what it matches (namely the dir foo and it's subdirectories.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">and while it's clear for &lt;Files foo&gt; (there is no hierarchy within filenames like the "/" with dirs)...
... &lt;Location /foo&gt; does not describe this.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">It's IMHO especially not clear, that no only the location "/foo" itself ist matched, but also any other locations that match "/foo/*".
"/foo*" locations seem to be _NOT_ matched.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">For LocationMatch it's IMHO clear, as it is simply the "open" PCRE-regexp (i.e. ^ and $ must bee added if the whole string should be matched)</sentence>

            <sentence id="5.1">This should be added at least here:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#location
and probably also here:
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/sections.html#file-and-web
within the "Webspace Containers" section.</sentence>
