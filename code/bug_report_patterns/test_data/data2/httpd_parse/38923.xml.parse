    <title>mod_speling incorrectly escapes linked URLs</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Given a misspelled request with more than one likely correct spelling,
mod_speling returns a list of variant spellings to the client.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When it does, it
may produce incorrect and/or broken links due to incorrect escaping of its
output.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">For example:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">[build (with --enable-speling) and install httpd-2.2.0]
[set "CheckSpelling On" in httpd.conf, and run httpd]
cd $PREFIX/htdocs
touch "lamp making"
touch "ramp making"
touch "&amp;amp making"
[visit /camp%20making in a browser (tested with Firefox)]
[note the broken link to "&amp; making"]</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">So mod_speling fails to perform html escaping on the uri-escaped filenames.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Not only that, it incorrectly escapes the "?"and contents of the query string
in variant spellings if a query string is included in the original request.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">For
example:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">touch foo
touch goo
[visit /yoo?hoo=%3f in a browser]
[note the broken links to "foo%3fhoo=%253f" and "goo%3fhoo=%253f"]</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">So it needs to perform uri escaping only on the filename part of each URL and
then add the "?" and query string to produce the link.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.2">Plus html-escaping the
whole thing (see first example).</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">As well, mod_speling output may include a link to the referring page.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">This link
needs to be html-escaped instead of being uri-escaped as it is now.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.3">It is
normally already uri-escaped by the browser, and double-escaping it will break
the link.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.4">For example, a referer URL of "http://example.com/foo?bar=%3f" becomes
"http://example.com/foo%3fbar=%253f", which refers to a resource named
"foo?bar=%3f" rather than a resource named "foo" plus a query string as
intended.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.5">If the browser isn't already sending properly escaped referer URLs,
then it probably deserves to be broken.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="8">
            <sentence id="8.1">As best I can tell, these bugs are also present in the 1.3.x and 2.0.x versions
of mod_speling.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="9">
            <sentence id="9.1">I'll plan to work on a patch later today unless someone else wants to do it.</sentence>
