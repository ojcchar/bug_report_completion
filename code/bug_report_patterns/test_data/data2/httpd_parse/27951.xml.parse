    <title>RequestHeader directive cannot be made conditionnal of env vars</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">On the process of setting up a [apache2] reverse proxy, it can happen that one
needs to set a RequestHeader depending on some conditions.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">It seems that, though the "Header" directive accepts an env var as
condition, this cannot be used with "RequestHeader", which seems to be a
"missing" feature, at least in the case of a Reverse Proxy.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">This is irrelevant for 1.3, as "RequestHeader" is new in 2.0</sentence>
