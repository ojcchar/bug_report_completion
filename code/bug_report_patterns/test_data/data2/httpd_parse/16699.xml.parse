            <sentence id="1.1">We have had a problem where a user clicks on a link and they get the following 
errors (2 browsers tested - more prominent on Netscape):</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">1 On Internet Explorer 5.5 they get a "page cannot be found" page, yet sometimes if you hit the back button on the browser the page you were trying to navigate to is actually there in the cache!</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">2 If they are using Netscape 4.79 they get a "network error" OK dialog box come up, even though the page they were trying to navigate to actually comes up beneath.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">I don't know much about the inner workings of clients/web servers but it's
almost as if the client makes that initial "hello" contact with the web
server, starts retrieving the document (and indeed often gets it) but there
is no "there you are, you've got it now - goodbye" message back from the
server and therefore the client thinks there was an error and throws up page
cannot be found or network error.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">The problem seems to happen more when the server is under heavier load but is 
intermittent.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">It also seems to have only started happening since about Apache 
version 2.035 or 2.036, though that may be coincidental.</sentence>

            <sentence id="4.1">In the error logs, there are lots of (&gt;500 a day) lines like this:</sentence>

the O/S is Windows 2000 Server SP2.</sentence>
