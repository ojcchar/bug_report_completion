    <title>401 vs 403 in httpd</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">httpd authorisation should return 403 instead of 401,
for example when a user is already authenticated but does not have the
rights to access to a page.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">For example in this case:
+++
[Mon Oct 02 11:04:57 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] access to /titu/
failed, reason: user 'jfclere' does not meet 'require'ments for user to
be allowed access
[Mon Oct 02 11:04:57 2006] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] user jfclere:
authorization failure for "/titu/":
+++
Instead 403 httpd asks again for authentication.</sentence>
