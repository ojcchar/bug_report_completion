        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">We run Apache 2.0.59 (32 bit .</sentence>

Bit.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">When EnableSendFile is enabled (the default) file transfers can be slow.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">For instance, on our gigabit lan, the file transfer would average around 300
kB/s.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">This only seemed to affect HTTP file transfers.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">HTTPS would be normal
speed.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.7">This bug only affected a few machines on the lan (we don't know why-
maybe some timing issue?)</sentence>

seem to have the problem on the same hardware).</sentence>
