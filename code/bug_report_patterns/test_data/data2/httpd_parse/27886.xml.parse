    <title>Default for config directive Scriptsock doesn't seem obey ServerRoot settings</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I just noticed for Apache 2.0.49, running on SPARC/Solaris, that if I change the
ServerRoot directive of my default server in httpd.conf, whilest leaving the
default (i.e. commented out) for the Scriptsock directive unchanged, the httpd
daemon continues to create a 'cgisock' socket in the default 'apache2/logs'
directory, even though all other entries (like logfiles, etc) are created
relative to the new definition of ServerRoot.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">I have verified this with to a minimum a modified httpd.conf file that I start
manually with '/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -f
/path/to/alternate/conf/httpd.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">conf -k start'.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Although this can easily be solved by explicitly adding the directive
'Scriptsock /path/to/alternate/logs/cgisock' to the 'httpd.conf' file, IMHO I
consider this being a bug.</sentence>
