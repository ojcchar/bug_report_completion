    <title>AddOutputFilterByType won't work reliably with PHP</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">PHP calls ap_set_content_type for generated content with an explicit content-type header.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">It calls it 
once at the beginning of the handler in order to set the content-type to the default (usually text/html) 
and then calls it again if the php script sends a Content-Type header.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">ap_set_content_type attaches filters configured by AddOutputFilterByType when it is called.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Consequently, PHP generated pages will have both the text/html output filters and the output filters for 
the actual content type added.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">As Nick Kew says in response to bug 31226, "AddOutputFilterbyType is known to be broken."</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">Fixing 
this problem does not appear to me to be easy; I would recommend documenting ap_set_content_type 
in include/http_protocol.h to add a warning that ap_set_content_type should not be called twice for the 
same request.</sentence>
