            <sentence id="2.2">It is confusing and it leads to this question: https://answers.openmrs.org/questions/1860/openmrs-manual-install-on-mac-log-in-as-root.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.2">OpenMRS has existed or not first.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">If not, attempt to create it, so we can avoid unnecessary fallback.</sentence>
