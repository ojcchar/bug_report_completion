    <title>HL7 scheduled task should not roll back transactions after exceptions caught in HL7Service</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">If a NullPointerException is encountered at some point during HL7 processing, the HL7Service will  create a new HL7InError object and attempt to move on.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Unfortunately, Spring detects this error and rolls back the changes, leaving the HL7 message at the top of the queue and hanging processing indefinitely.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">This does not occur if an HL7Exception is thrown, only when an unexpected exception occurs.</sentence>
