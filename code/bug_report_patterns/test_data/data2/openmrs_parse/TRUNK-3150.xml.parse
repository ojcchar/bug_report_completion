    <title>"true" and "false" concepts loaded improperly in ConceptServiceImpl</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The designated concept id for "true" and "false" are stored as global properties within the system.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">The ConceptServiceImpl has two static variables, trueConcept and falseConcept, that stores these "true" and "false" concepts.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">However, instead of loading the true and false concepts from the DB, ConceptServiceImpl initializes trueConcept and falseConcept by creating dummy concepts initialized with the appropriate concept ids.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Therefore the trueConcept and falseConcept variables get random uuids, not the uuids of the underlying concepts.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">This is problematic--for one, starting in OpenMRS 1.9 object comparsions are done using uuids, so  someObs.getValueAsBoolean() will *always* return null.</sentence>
