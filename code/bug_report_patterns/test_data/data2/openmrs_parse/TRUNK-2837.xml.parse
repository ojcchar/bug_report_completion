    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When a user clicks the back button in the installation wizard, they always go to the next page, this is because the input type for the back/continue buttons is image meaning the browser is submitting x,y coordinates instead of the expecetd value 'back'.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Change the input type back to Submit and set the images as the background for the inputs.</sentence>
