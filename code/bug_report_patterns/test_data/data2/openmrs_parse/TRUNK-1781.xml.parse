    <title>Disambiguate the void and delete functions on edit patient page</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">There is a voided checkbox on the edit patient page.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">By checking that, it actually means "deleting patients from view".</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Then, on the bottom of that page, it has another button called "delete patient" next to "save patient".</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">It's confusing to have two items (one voided checkbox and one delete patient button) on the same page while they both pretty much do the same thing - deleting the patient.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">See the user edit page for how the void patient should be handled (user has retire and delete though).</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">The "void patient" section should be changed to have wording like "delete patient".</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">The "delete patient" button should be something like "completely remove data" (or similar).</sentence>
