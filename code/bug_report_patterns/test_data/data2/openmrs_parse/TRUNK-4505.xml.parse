    <title>Display one editing concept message on edit concept page and handle when and how to validate Fully Specified Name* field</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">"Editing Concept conceptName" message should not show up on the editing concept page, see http://snag.gy/X4yki.jpg since it interferes with our page design and it is already included on the same page a few lines below.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Additional issue to handle on the same page is;</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">should we check whether fully specified name of a concept exist when editing a concept and the user seems to edit its field but ends up with a similar name as before or when same name is entered for different locales, see http://snag.gy/aHAkg.jpg this is interfering and may scare the user since the check is automatically performed even when the concept will be saved with similar fully specified names for more than one locales?</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">When can we validate the Fully Specified Name\* field, is it when saving the concept or automatically as it is currently? and if we automatically validate that field, must we perform the validation at every entry of character(s) in the field for any of the available locales, in other-wards how can we better validate this?</sentence>
