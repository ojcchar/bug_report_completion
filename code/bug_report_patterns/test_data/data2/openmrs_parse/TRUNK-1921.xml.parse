            <sentence id="2.1">The JTDS JDBC driver, found here: http://jtds.sourceforge.net/ is not supported by OpenMRS as the DatabaseUtil class assumes that if the connectionURL contains "sqlserver" that you are using the microsoft drivers.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">The fix is trivial, the loadDatabaseDriver method simply needs to add this check just before the check for "sqlserver".</sentence>
