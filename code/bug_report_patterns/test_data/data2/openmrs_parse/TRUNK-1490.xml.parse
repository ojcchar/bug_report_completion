    <title>Error upgrading to OpenMRS 1.6 data model when Patient Flags module is installed</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When upgrading to the OpenMRS 1.6 data model with the Patient Flags module installed, the renaming of the role "System Developer" to "Administrator" (see ticket TRAC-1499) could potentially fail due a foreign key constraint, since the table patientflags_tag_role references role as a foreign key.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The liquibase update script needs to rename "System Developer" to "Administrator" any time it occurs in the patientflags_tag_role table.</sentence>
