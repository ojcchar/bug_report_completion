    <title>Patient Search Timeout Error Handling</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When the OpenMRS patient search screen is left open, the session times out.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Good.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">But, when the user returns back to the computer, and types a name to search for, it is not obvious that their session has expired, but rather looks like there are just no patients for that search.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">It displays a small error in the status bar, "DWR warning/error: Privileges Required: [Patients|View]".</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">Rather than this error, it should display the standard: "You must log in to continue" error and prompt for the username and password box to log in again.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">This is the way it is handled in other areas in the interface.</sentence>
