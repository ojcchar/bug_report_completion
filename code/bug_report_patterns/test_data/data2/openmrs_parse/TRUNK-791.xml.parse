    <title>Groovy Module: exceptions are not properly captured</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Prior to rev:7380, the exception message and stack trace was returned to the client whenever an exception occurred within a Groovy script. This behavior should be restored.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Currently, the following script just never returns instead of returning the exception message and stack trace:
{code}foo = null
print foo.bar()
{code}</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">
The above code should return a null pointer exception and stack trace as it did before.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">NOTE: I had an uncommitted change that didn't get committed prior to Groovy module's 1.3 changes.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">I had changed the {{catch Exception \{\}}} to a {{catch Throwable \{\}}} around the script evaluation.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">I believe that catching {{Throwable}} was working better for me, but can't remember the exact reasons/details.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">In any case, I would suggest using a {{catch Throwable \{\}}} around the script evaluation unless we find a specific reason why {{catch Exception \{\}}} is better.</sentence>
