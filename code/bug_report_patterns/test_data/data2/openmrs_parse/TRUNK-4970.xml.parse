    <title>Obs retrieval from the encounter should maintain the same order in which it is added</title>

        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Java 8 has changes to HashSet that the retrieval order is not guaranteed to be same with insertion order.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">So obs retrieval methods can use LinkedHashSet to maintain the insertion order.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Since obs retrieval methods are used in encounter save method, obs are not saved in the order it is added to the encounter</sentence>
