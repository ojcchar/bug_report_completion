            <sentence id="2.1">An embedded Quicktime movie from a password-protected directory (with a qtaccess
file, similar to .htaccess for Apache) on a QuickTime Streaming Server pops up
an authentication window for username/password.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">(The username/password for the
testpage mentioned above is test/test.)</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">With Firefox 1.0.2 on a Mac it it not possible to type any text in the
authentication window, so it is not possible to view the movie.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">It seems that
Firefox doesn't give keyboard focus to the authentication window.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">Reproducible: Always</sentence>

        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">1 Make sure that Quicktime is installed</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">2 Go to http://janpieter.xs4all.nl/firefox_test/</sentence>

        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Actual Results:  
Not possible to login because text fields in the authentication window don't
receive keystrokes.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">Expected Results:  
Should make it possible to type text in the authentication window and send the
credentials to the server when clicking OK button.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">Also reproduced the bug in the Mozilla suite and in the latest Firefox 1.0.3
nightly build.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="8">
            <sentence id="8.1">I filed the bug under 'OS Integration' because I have the impression that the
nonresponsive authentication window is generated by the Quicktime plugin, not
Firefox itself.</sentence>
