            <sentence id="2.1">A bug that I have noticed with the newest RC is that when using Verisoft Access manager (2.1.2) the system will pick up a web page in Firefox when all the sites have been cleared out and once the user name and password credentials are submitted to the Verisoft system it works fine, however once I go to a new page and the system picks up the information in Firefox it gives me the same name as the previous web site that has been recorded and tires to submit those credentials. For Example setting up T-Mobile.com and submitting those credentials, then closing out of Firefox 3 rc 2 and then opening it back up and going to myspace.com and when the login info is picked up the system suggests adding new credentials for the site "T-Mobile.com"  </sentence>
