            <sentence id="2.1">I like to use an em dash when I'm writing, and because Gmail doesn't have the function I always have to go to a Word document and do a copy and paste of the em dash.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Fine.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">But here's the problem.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">Beginning with some recent Firefox update (sorry, I don't know which one exactly), I now get an annoying string of code when I do the paste from Word into my Gmail.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">I'm assuming this is a Firefox issue and not a Gmail issue because in the past I never had an issue with Gmail.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">So for your convenience I've pasted below the code that now always shows up in Gmail when I paste an em dash from Word (you can see the em dash at the very end of the code).</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">I hope you can correct this little problem so that in the future when I paste the em dash, the em dash is all that gets pasted without any accompanying code/text.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">If I've been unclear in explaining it, please shoot me an e-mail and I'll go into it a bit further.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.4">Thanks!</sentence>
