            <sentence id="2.1">When opening csv-file libreoffice-calc tries to set an optimal default width for columns.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">But it fails if some cells has multiline content.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">Column width for a column, that contains multiline cells defaults to very large (i think it just counts max number of characters in every cell and ignores the fact that there are line breaks).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">* see attached example file</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">If after opening the file i r-click on the column header and select "optimal column width" - column shrinks properly to fit the cells.</sentence>

            <sentence id="4.1">This bug is more hurting because resizing very wide columns is now broken ( see bug https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57361 )</sentence>
