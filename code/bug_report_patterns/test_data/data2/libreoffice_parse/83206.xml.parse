            <sentence id="2.1">Problem description: 
The European Portuguese spell checker which comes included in the installation doesn't use the orthographic agreement of 1990 (the most recent).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">It's necessary to change this because this is what Portugal officially adopted between 2010 and 2012.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">The best option would be to include both dictionaries but use the orthographic agreement as default.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">Currently it's necessary to download and install the orthographic agreement dictionary manually from https://pt.libreoffice.org/dicionarios-extensoes-e-modelos/ (Dicionário em versão Acordo Ortográfico).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">The UI itself uses the agreement (try writing "atualizações" too, just like in the help section).</sentence>
