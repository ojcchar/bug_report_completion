    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Formulae and text in text boxes formatted as Linux Libertine G italic in MS Windows 7 (and previous versions) appears as a sans serif font in Linux Ubuntu 14.04.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">I assume that means that it is unsupported.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Changing to Linux Libertine O corrects the problem   
I am seeing the correct font as one similar to TNR italic.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">I will check, but from memory, Libertine O in ubuntu is not supported in MS Windows.</sentence>
