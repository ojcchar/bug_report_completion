    <title>VIEWING: Image anchor does not appear with paragraph to which it is anchored</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">0 Turn on non-printing characters (Control+F10 by default)</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">1 Insert two empty paragraphs</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">2 Insert an image on the first empty paragraph with anchoring to paragraph</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">3a.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">Set the image's vertical alignment to top.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.7">You will see the anchor icon aligned to the topline of the image, but not over the paragraph sign to which the image is anchored</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.8">3b.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.9">Set the image's vertical alignment to bottom and try to anchor the image to the second empty paragraph by moving the anchor icon.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.10">You will see the anchor icon move just one line down, instead of over the second empty paragraph sign.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Expected behavior:
On either case (3a or 3b), it is expected to have the anchor icon move over the paragraph sign to which the image will be attached.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">This would let the user know, precisely, to which paragraph will the image be anchored.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">Other behavior is misleading and can lead to frustration!</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Operating System: All
Version: 4.0.4.2 release</sentence>
