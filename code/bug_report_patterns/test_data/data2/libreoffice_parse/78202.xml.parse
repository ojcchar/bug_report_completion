    <title>CALC 4.2.1 import from xls: no chance to reset Hyperlink-format</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I have copied cells from a xls-table with address-data containing email-addresses formated as hyperlink (mailto: etc)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">-- that cell is formatted as "Excel_BuiltIn_Hyperlink"</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">-- can not be selected with a mouse-click on it - go there with the cursor works</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">-- can not set to format "standard" or to "remove all format" except with the format-menu, but that has no real effect, it is labeld as standard, but the hyperlink is behaving as before</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">-- casewise: can not be copied directly but in a range only</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">-- can not be pasted without format (paste content only)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">up to now the content needs to be retyped - which is quite nasty</sentence>
