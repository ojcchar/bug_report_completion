    <title>UI: Menu "Tools &gt; Language &gt; ... &gt; More..." shows Character Dialog</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Problem description: 
When accessing the menu Tools &gt; Language &gt; Selection &gt; More... or Tools &gt; Language &gt; Paragraph &gt; More..., the Font dialog is displayed.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Furthermore (though this may be out of the scope for this report), a different language dictionary (in my case, French) did not show up as an option until I checked for spelling in English, and selected "French (France)" from the "Text language" drop-down menu.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">In Microsoft Word, selecting "More..." should show a dialog to select the language for that selection, not the application's global settings.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">LibreOffice shows global settings when accessing Tools &gt; Language &gt; For all text &gt; More...</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Also, I think the languages displayed in that menu should reflect the document's language use (if that metadata is stored) or the most recent languages used, with an option to clear the history.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">I remember seeing Creole (or some other language) that I've never used at all for spellcheck!</sentence>

        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">1 Highlight some text.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">2 Access the menu: Tools &gt; Language &gt; Selection &gt; More... OR Tools &gt; Language &gt; Paragraph &gt; More...</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.4">3 Get the Font Dialog instead.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Alternatively, do not highlight any text (assuming freshly opened) and access those menus.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">Current behavior:
Opening the Font Dialog</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">Expected behavior:
Opening a language selection dialog for the selection/paragraph</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="8">
            <sentence id="8.1">I am unsure if this is a Linux-only issue or not, so please consider other platforms as well!</sentence>
