    <title>FORMATTING: Bullet &amp; Numbering indentation wrong</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">1 Open a new document.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">2 Hit bullet points option (Shift+F12)</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">3 Type anything.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">Hit enter to go to next bullet.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">4 Increase indentation.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.7">Decrease indentation.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.8">5 Bullet should be mis-aligned.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Current behavior:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Bullets are misaligned and stay misaligned (if you hit enter on a misaligned bullet to create a new one they do not get re-aligned)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Expected behavior:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Bullets should be nicely aligned with one another just as one would expect.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">If this has been fixed in more recent versions the fix should be backported to stable.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.3">If this has been backported to stable and just not pushed as an update to Fedora yet (version number provided) please say so.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">This also affects numbering, so i'm guessing its something in the indentation code not detecting that its currently in a number / bullet list mode or not respecting that mode.</sentence>
