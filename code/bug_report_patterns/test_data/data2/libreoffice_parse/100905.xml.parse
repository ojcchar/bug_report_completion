            <sentence id="1.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">1 Take LibreOffice Writer document with consistent fonts [but not set as default], size, spacing, etc.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">2 Create table in document</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">3 Split table in document</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">4 Now the line between the two tables is in the default, with different size and spacing from the rest of the document.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">It's easy enough to fix the fonts, but I haven't found any way to fix the spacing, except to undo the split and everything since.</sentence>
