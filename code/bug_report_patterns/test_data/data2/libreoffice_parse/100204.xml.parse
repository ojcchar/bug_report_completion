        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">HYPERLINK does not work with the file names containing number sign '#'.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Example:
=HYPERLINK("file:///home/user/MyFile - #1234 - Report.ods","MyFile - #1234 - Report.ods")</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Expected behavior: open the file with Ctrl+Click</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Current behavior: nothing happens</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">Behavior in case the file name is wrong: a dialog box appears (so it is not our case here, no dialog box appears)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">If the number sign is deleted from the first argument and from the file name on the hard disk then everything works fine, so it is easy to reproduce and 'blame' the number sign.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Important: the hyperlinks introduced via the hyperlink dialog box with Ctrl+K work fine.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">The bug refers to the hyperlink introduced via HYPERLINK function in the cell (in order to avoid any confusion).</sentence>
