        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I tried to use the user defined animation "increas font size" (in German: Schriftgröße ändern) with the default value 150% and I get an undefined picture of the font color.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This is a regression to former versions of OOo / LibreOffice.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">It worked in my former presentations very well.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">This error occurs if I don't use hardware acceleration.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">If I use hardware acceleration every thing works fine.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">I tested the same animation (same presentation) with OOo 3.4-m100 (without hardware acceleration) and every thing works as expected.</sentence>
