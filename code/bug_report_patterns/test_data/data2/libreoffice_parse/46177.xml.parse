            <sentence id="2.4">[4] Choose “Align right”.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">Expected behaviour: 
Change of alignment to left-aligned and insert of tabs from the left page margin if you click with the Direct Cursor into an empty and right aligned paragraph.</sentence>

            <sentence id="4.1">With Direct Cursor option “Tabs and spaces” the behaviour is equal and hence also not correct.</sentence>
