    <title>Easier toolbar editing / customization (allow drag &amp; drop)</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The current toolbars are very flexible, but they are painful to manage/edit because you cannot use drag and drop to do so.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Instead, you need to go into Tools &gt; Customize, mess with categories and open/close dialogs each time you want to add an item, which is quite tedious.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Ideally, we should have a user interface that is drag-and-drop based, supports searching, has a live/immediate feedback and uses direct manipulation.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">One of the best examples of such an interface is Firefox's (or Epiphany's) toolbar editing system.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">It's might not perfect, but it is pretty close.</sentence>
