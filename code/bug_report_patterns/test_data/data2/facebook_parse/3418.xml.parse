        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The notification allocations_ which employ the spam reports and  hide all on first impression  stats are fundamentally flawed.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Unlike the email-like message inbox_ there is no way for a user to simply delete notifications.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Instead_ a user who wants to clean up the inbox has to choose between  Report as Spam  and  Hide All .</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">As a result_ it is impossible to know how many of the  Report as Spam  and  Hide All  clicks are just a result of users who want to delete old messages rather than genuine reports.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">No amount of algorithmic sophistication can make up for this fundamental flaw in the stats; you simply don t know how many false positives are included in your sample.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">How difficult is it to add a third option to simply  Delete  a notification?</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">This would satisfy users  needs to clean up the notification inbox without distorting the spam report and hide all statistics.</sentence>
