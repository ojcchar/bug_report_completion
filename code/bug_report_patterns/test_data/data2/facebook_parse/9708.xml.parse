    <title>Need a safe way to display items to only friends of the user on application tab</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I do not understand the thought process behind having the visible-to-connection tag display the contents at all times_ just in a visibility:hidden source.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Can we get a safe way to display information only to friends of a user within an application tab?</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">It would make the most sense if this tag and its contents simply disappeared when a non-friend/non-fan views an application tab.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">This may be similar to bug 2814_ but I wasn t sure whether it is strictly a duplicate or not.</sentence>
