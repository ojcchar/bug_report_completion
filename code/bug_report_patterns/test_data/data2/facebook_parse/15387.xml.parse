        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I haven t received any Insights updated data for my page since 2/16/2011 (http://www.facebook.com/sobongo) We have executed facebook ads and ran promotions and have not seen a increase in likes_ which historically we have seen close to 1_000 as of result of the same executions.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">I have reason to believe that there is a issue affecting our fan page and hindering our reporting.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Another rarity is that our lifetime total likes nearly doubled between 2/15 and 2/16 but our total number of likes has remained consistent.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Is it possible that our lifetime likes is actually our number of accurate likes?</sentence>
