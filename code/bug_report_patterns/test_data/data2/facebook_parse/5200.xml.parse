Bug:
The fbml fb:js-string does not work with the fb:title tag.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">For example_ if you use the below code_ the title on the page should be  Initial Title  as the other fb:title tag is encapsulated within the fb:js-string.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">However_ the  New title set within....  is the title on the page as the fbml parser is ignoring the fb:js-string tag and using the title encapsulated within
    &lt;fb:title&gt;Initial Title&lt;/fb:title&gt;
    &lt;fb:js-string var= newtitle &gt;
        &lt;fb:title&gt;New title set within fb js-string variable&lt;/fb:title&gt;
    &lt;/fb:js-string&gt;</sentence>
