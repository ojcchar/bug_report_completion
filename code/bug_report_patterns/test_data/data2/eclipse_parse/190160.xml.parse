            <sentence id="2.2">I have been running Jtest's BugDetective feature on BIRT source code and it reported a few places where an inefficient iteration over map takes place.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">From the point of view of efficiency it is better to iterate over the set of map entries rather than, having obtained a key set, extract a corresponding value (which is considered to be a very consuming operation) at every single iteration.</sentence>
