    <title>[WorkbenchParts] Link smooth sash resizing to the "Enable animations" preference</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Currently, the Eclipse UI always uses the SMOOTH style for its sashes.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This
feature is not always desirable, especially on slower machines.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">There is already a preference in the Appearance tab called "Enable animations".</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">It seems logical to me to have this behaviour linked to this preference.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">This
seems easy to hook up, although it only takes full effect when you restart Eclipse.</sentence>
