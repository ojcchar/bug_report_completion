    <title>[JUnit] Upon "Unknown Source" in a stacktrace,  a double-click should open the properties-Java Build Path - Libraries [JUnit]</title>

        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">in a junit test run, I get the following stack trace</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">at java.text.SimpleDateFormat.format(SimpleDateFormat.java:775)</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">	at javax.mail.internet.MailDateFormat.format(Unknown Source)</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">	at java.text.DateFormat.format(DateFormat.java:314)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">While for all the other source files, a double click brings me into the right
place in the source file, understandably this doesn't happen for the "Unknown
Source" case.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">However, it would be great if upon a double click there, the Project
properties-Java Build Path-Libraries would open the concerned library where I
could attach the source.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">This would be especially useful if the .class file is present in multiple .jar
files because it then would bring to the one implementation that gets really used.</sentence>
