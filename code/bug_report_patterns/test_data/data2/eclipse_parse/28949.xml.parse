    <title>[find/replace] retain caps when replacing</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">often it happens that you want to change a word that appears throughout the 
code (or documentation) in different caps, an example:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">MyWord word = null;
MyWord currentWord = null;</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">when performing a replace now, say, "word" by "phrase", you get:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Myphrase phrase = null;
Myphrase currentphrase = null;</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">This is definitely not what you'd like it to become...
When using case sensitive replacement, the second 'word' does not get replaced, 
resulting in the following piece of code:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">MyPhrase word = null;
MyPhrase currentPhrase = null;</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">I'd like to see a 'retain-caps-while-replacing option' that cause that replaces 
the first character's caps of the replacing word if required; if the first 
letter of the substring to be replaced is a capital, then make the first 
character of the replacing string a capital, if it is a smallcap, make it a 
smallcap.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">This results in the desired piece of code:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="8">
            <sentence id="8.1">MyPhrase phrase = null;
MyPhrase currentPhrase = null;</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="9">
            <sentence id="9.1">remark: the second 'word' has been replaced by 'phrase' as we hoped it to be.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="10">
            <sentence id="10.1">thanks!</sentence>
