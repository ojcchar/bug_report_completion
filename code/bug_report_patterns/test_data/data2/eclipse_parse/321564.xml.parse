            <sentence id="2.1">Add these files:

            <sentence id="3.1">1 Enter "read.ext&lt;" into the dialog</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">==&gt; also matches reada.ext.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.4">==&gt; matches more than just A.t</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.6">==&gt; matches A.text, expected: no match</sentence>

        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">1 is a bug while 2 and 3 could be argued to work as expected but personally I think it is more natural to treat the '&lt;' as switch for using exact matching.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Besides that the help needs to be updated and also talk about the file extension matching a bit more.</sentence>
