            <sentence id="2.1">I am not sure how to describe the various problems I am now seeing since I 
have seen a variety of problems.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">However, they all seem to have a common 
theme.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">The underlying Java Model for a given class is not being updated 
properly as new methods are added or methods are changed.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">The two examples that I am consistently running across now are:</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">1 Search for a given method, and double click in the Task window to bring up the java source.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">Add a new method to the file.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.4">I noticed that the Outline view nor the Type Hierarchy were updated with the new method.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.5">The subclasses which did not implement the abstract method were not flagged with errors.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">2 Modified a method signature by adding a new parameter.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">I received two errors in my task where classes were using the API.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">The first one was changed without a problem.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.4">However the second one, when I try to use Context Assist, the method is showing 2 parameters instead of 3, and the new API added above does not appear as an option.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.5">After closing the window with the added parameter, the Context Assist is showing 3 parameters but the new method is not appearing as a valid choice.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Its almost like there are multiple working copies and what I see is the wrong 
one.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">So when I close the window and re-open the file, everything is ok.</sentence>
