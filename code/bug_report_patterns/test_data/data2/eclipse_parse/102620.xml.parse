    <title>CVS perspective's "Compare With" does not use synchronize view</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">In the CVS Repository Exploring perspective, if you select "Compare With" on a
branch or version, it eventually opens a "Structured Compare" window showing all
the changes.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This means you cannot benefit from the Synchronize view's changeset
support -- you can access diffs, but no commit log information.</sentence>
