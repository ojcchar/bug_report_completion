            <sentence id="3.1">In the API of 'EnumDeclaration' the two lists (constants and classbody
declaration) are modelled in one list (body declarations)</sentence>

            <sentence id="4.1">Wouldn't it be better to have this is two lists?</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">I'm currently working on the
AST rewriter and this gets quite tricky: The separator between the list nodes
depends on the node type (separators are ',', ';' and new lines)
Replacing a node can result in changing the separator before and after the node.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">This is of course all doable, but represents a special case, no other list of
nodes is as complicated.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.4">Any chance that the lists can be separated?</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.5">I also think the merging of the
lists is also conceptionally a hack.</sentence>
