        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">I downloaded the latest Eclipse 3.3 (RC4) for linux-gtk (32 bit), and used jdk1.6.0_01 (32 bit) and 1.5.0_11 (32 bit) to reproduce this under Ubuntu 7.04 (i386).</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">If I try to open any txt or java files, the editor tab launches (showing "Java Editor" or "Text Editor"), but then hangs and does nothing, and I have to close Eclipse.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">I was also receiving this error on Eclipse 3.3 RC3 , but I thought it might be a corrupt download or quick-fix bug in RC4.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">I've tried every combination of new projects, imported projects, clean workspaces, using the "-clean" switch, blowing away/freshly extracting Eclipse, and the problem simply won't go away.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.4">During the shutdown process, I receive a dialog that says NullPointerException, but I can't expand the dialog (the "Details" button doesn't do anything), and it's impossible to close the dialog, so I must force-kill the process.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">There is nothing in the error log to say what might be the problem, so unfortunately I don't have a stack trace or anything to help, but the latest Eclipse 3.3 RCs are useless without editors :)</sentence>
