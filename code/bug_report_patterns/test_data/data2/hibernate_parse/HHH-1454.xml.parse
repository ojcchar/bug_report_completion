    <title>select new UILine(a,a.b) from A a: unable to locate appropriate constructor when A is an entity-name </title>

        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When i introduced the entity-name indirection into the code, for class A (where my entity-name "A" actually equals the class name "A", without the package), all of the sudden, this [select new UILine(a,b) from A a, a.b b] no longer works because hibernate can't find a constructor for UILine(1,2) who's arguments match the types of a and b.</sentence>
