    <title>DetachedCriteria with Projections generates invalid SQL when using inheritance with PostgreSQL</title>

        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">PostgreSQL doesn't allow using aliases in the WHERE clause.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">For example, the following query is invalid:
SELECT it.id_item as aaa FROM Item it WHERE aaa=1
The correct query would be:
SELECT it.id_item as aaa FROM Item it WHERE it.id_item=1</sentence>
