    <title>Inserting BIT to PostgreSQL table</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I created a Table which has a column active as Boolean in the entity and the HBM file specifies the type as boolean.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When I use this configuration with MySQL it works fine, but when I use it with PostgreSQL I get an javax.sql.BatchUpdateException.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">so later I changed the HBM file 'active' column type to 'yes_no' and than it works fine.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">So I confirmed that the problem is due to the BIT(1) column.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">So I next tried to manually insert into the column and it PgSQL tells that 1 needs to be casted.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">Please let me know if I can help in other ways, I will be most grateful to help.</sentence>
