        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The way hibernate handles hibernate.cache.region_prefix varies between the Region types.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When RegionFactory.buildQueryResultsRegion() and buildTimestampsRegion() are called, any region_prefix is prepended to the passed regionName.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">With entities and collection's it is not.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">(01:45:56 PM) bes: well, I looked in hibernate-core for usages of Settings.getCacheRegionPrefix() and the only usage was in the StandardQueryCache and UpdateTimestampsCache classes
(01:48:48 PM) steve: oh, i think i just missed that for entity and collections
(01:49:02 PM) steve: it used to be handled by a class no longer there</sentence>
