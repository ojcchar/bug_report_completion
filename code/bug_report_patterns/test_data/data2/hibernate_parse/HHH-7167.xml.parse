    <title>The new natural id code introduced in 4.1.1 depends on the order the entity persisters are loaded which leads to fatal errors</title>

            <sentence id="2.1">After upgrade to 4.1.1, our application doesn't work anymore because the sqlEntityIdByNaturalIdString field of the entity persister is null while it shouldn't be.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">The problem is that the new code requires the entityPersisters to be postInstantiate()d in a specific order namely the root entity persister should be initialized before the child classes (which is not guaranteed at all and is not the case in our application because of the way our classes are organized).</sentence>

        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">In our case, the entities are loaded in this order (pseudo code):

@Entity

            <sentence id="5.1">@Entity

            <sentence id="6.1">Which is a problem because of the way AbstractEntityPersister.generateEntityIdByNaturalIdSql() now works:

        <paragraph id="8">
            <sentence id="8.1">In this case, we should force the postInstantiation of the root entity persister before using sqlEntityIdByNaturalIdString (or we should at least generate its sqlEntityIdByNaturalIdString).</sentence>
