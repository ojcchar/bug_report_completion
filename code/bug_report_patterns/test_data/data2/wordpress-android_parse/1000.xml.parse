    <title>Comment paging needs to handle the gap between new and cached</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Comments are loaded 20 at a time.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When you scroll to the end of them, the next 20 are loaded.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">But since comments are cached, there's a chance you could miss some due to the gap between new comments are those cached.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Ex: if you previously loaded 20 comments then use the app again after 40 more comments were posted, you'd get the most recent 20 of those comments but 20 of them would never show up.</sentence>
