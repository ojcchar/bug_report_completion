    <title>Reader: add backstack to tag preview</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">In tag preview, tapping the back button doesn't navigate back through the tags you've previewed.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Change this by remembering the previewed tags and enable back navigation.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Note that this should be done without creating a new fragment for each tag.</sentence>
