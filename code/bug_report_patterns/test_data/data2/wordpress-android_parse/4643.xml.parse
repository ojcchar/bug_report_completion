        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">### Expected/Actual behavior</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When you tap "Reply" on a comment push notification, it opens the comment notification in the app and the expectation is that you can start typing the reply immediately.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">However, the reply field doesn't get focus when the app is opened, so the user has to tap into the field to start replying.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Ideally we could give the reply field focus immediately so the user can start typing their reply without having to search for the reply field first.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">From @designsimply:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">&gt; When I tapped “REPLY” on the push notification, I expected the keyboard to open but it didn’t (WPAndroid 6.0-rc-1 on Galaxy Tab4 &amp; Android 5.1.1).</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.7">It took me a minute to figure out that I had to tap at the far bottom left to trigger the keyboard to start writing a reply.</sentence>

            <sentence id="2.1">### Steps to reproduce the behavior</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">1 With the app closed, comment on a blog post (from another account) to trigger a comment notification</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">2 View the push notification for the comment and tap "Reply"</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">3 Wait for the app to open</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Result: The reply field doesn't gain focus, and the keyboard doesn't appear, so you have to tap in the reply field to begin your reply.</sentence>
