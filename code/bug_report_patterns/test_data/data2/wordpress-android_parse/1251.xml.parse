    <title>"First" empty views should indicate the app is loading content</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Empty view says there are no posts while loading:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">- From Settings, show a blog that you haven’t shown on your account before.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">- switch to posts and you’ll see the loading indicator below the action bar.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">- screen will say “no posts, why not create one?</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">” which is clearly not the case because the app still hasn’t finished loading them.</sentence>
