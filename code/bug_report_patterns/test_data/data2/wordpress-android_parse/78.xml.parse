    <title>Blog URLs with umlauts may break the app</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Originally reported by a user, the use of umlauts such as ü, ä, ö may render the app unusable - you can't add the blog to the app.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Using the full untranslated URL doesn't seem to help (e.g. "​http://xn--bcher-kva.de/" for "​http://bücher.de").</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">More investigation required.</sentence>
