    <title>Support async connections to fluent servers</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">`github.com/docker/docker/daemon/logger/fluentd` currently blocks on connecting to `fluend`, and fails to start new containers if it cannot be reached.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">There are plenty of scenarios where this is not the desired behaviour; the most obvious one is that `fluend` might be started in a local container.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">`fluent-logger-golang` got support for async connections through fluent/fluent-logger-golang#25;</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">we simply need to update the dependency and add an option to our logger.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">The PR will use a git commit on this dependency unless we get a new release in the meantime; it was requested in fluent/fluent-logger-golang#26.</sentence>
