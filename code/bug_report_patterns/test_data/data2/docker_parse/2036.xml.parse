    <title>"docker add" last modified date check</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Currently when we are building an image using a `Dockerfile`, `ADD` command does not check last modified date of the file.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">So `docker build` always started to build the image after it saw an ADD command.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">So caching won't be used after that.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">#### Always put `ADD` commands at the end of the `Dockerfile`</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">This solution works for most cases.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">But sometime we need some shell scripts to install and configure our images when building.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">Since, once we do something like this, after this line caching is disabled.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">This is not a huge issue, but checking `lastModifiedData` in `Docker ADD` will make build process faster</sentence>
