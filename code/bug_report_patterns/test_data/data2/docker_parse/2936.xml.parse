        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Some Docker users have found documentation on the Internet which still hasn't been updated to reflect the fact that the 'base' image is being deprecated and that the 'ubuntu' images should be used instead.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Some other users have been using Docker since 'base' was the image the docs were recommending as the standard image.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">There should be a way to let users know an image has been deprecated.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Here are some options on how users could be warned or notified that a particular image is being deprecated :</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">1 display a warning on the index page of that image (can be combined with other options or used as a standalone option)</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">2 display a warning when the user pulls the image from the registry (alternative to 3)</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">3 start serving the image with a deprecation flag once it's marked for deprecation (alternative to 2)</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.6">4 add a new flag to 'docker pull' which only checks if an image (or any of its layers) is marked for deprecation (could be used together with 1 and 2)</sentence>
