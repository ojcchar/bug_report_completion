            <sentence id="2.1">I use docker for developing Ruby on Rails apps and ever since I remember leveraging 'docker exec' to spawn new 'rails console' / 'irb' / 'guard' exec instances based on a running rails app container I noticed that when I 'Ctrl+C' it ends up just killing the exec instance right away, but if I 'docker exec bash' and run an 'irb' session from there it works as expected (as in the process is not killed).</sentence>
