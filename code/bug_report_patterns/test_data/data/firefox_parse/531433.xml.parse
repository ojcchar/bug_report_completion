			<sentence id="2.1">Within the addon named Firemath we use the scheme described at
https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/window#User_Notes
to add a favicon to a window element opened in a new tab.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This works in FF3.5.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">In FF3.6b4 a warning is shown in the error console saying "XUL box for window element contained an inline link child, forcing all its children to be wrapped in a block".</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">What is worse is that the rendering of the window contents is broken.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">Removing the line starting with "&lt;html:link..." the rendering works and the warning is not shown, but the favicon does not appear.</sentence>
