			<sentence id="2.1">The context menu option "Save Image As" does not validate if the src image is
valid.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">By using absolute positioning and the moz-opacity filter an attacker can
easily fool the user to think he is going to save a valid image but is
downloading an executable file instead.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Since file extensions are default disabled on windows and an exe files can have
any file icon - including the standard image icon - the user can only tell the
difference when he recognizes that the save dialog file type drop down shows
"Application" instead of an image file.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">Unlikely average users will see that or
realize the consequences.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">Probably most poeple will just double-click the "image
file" they downloaded when they are going to view it and will run the executable
in that moment.</sentence>

			<sentence id="6.1">It seems Firefox sometimes raises an "the web page might have been removed or
its name changed" error when supplying a larger exe directly as an image source
and then trying to save it (is that a bug or a security feature?)</sentence>

attacker can work around this problem with a little php script like this:</sentence>
