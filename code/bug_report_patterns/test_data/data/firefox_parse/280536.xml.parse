			<sentence id="2.1">When I open the website at http://www.grendel-base.com a popup is blocked.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Clicking the icon for popup configuration in the bottom right, I have the option
to "Allow popups for www.grendel-base.com" and "Show:
http://www.industrialnation.nl/grendel/frameset.htm" because the popup is
located on another server.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">This is correct and not an attempt to hijack the
browser or something, but rather a technique used by lots of website owners who
store their website on a free webhoster and own a domain with very limited storage.</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">Reproducible: Always</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">1 Open www.grendel-base.com with popup blocking enabled</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">2 "Allow popups for "Allow popups for www.grendel-base.com"</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">Actual Results:</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.5">Nothing happens, no popup.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.6">Only way tt see the popup is to open it manually via "Show:</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.7">http://www.industrialnation.nl/grendel/frameset.htm" and that everytime since it</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.8">does not create a ruleset.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Expected Results:  
Popup that was called FROM www.grendel-base.com should be opened as well as
those STORED ON www.grendel-base.com and a ruleset should be created for this,
since a user with no knowledge about servers and redirects will not know what
went wrong and blame it on Firefox.</sentence>
