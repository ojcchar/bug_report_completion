			<sentence id="2.1">During the 1.4 cycle, a feature landed in SeaMonkey that displayed a
confirmation dialog when attempting to close a browser window with multiple open
tabs.</sentence>

and frustrating mistake for users new to tabbed browsing.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Should be toggle-able
via a checkbox in the confirmation dialog, and perhaps an option to turn it back
on in Advanced pane.</sentence>
