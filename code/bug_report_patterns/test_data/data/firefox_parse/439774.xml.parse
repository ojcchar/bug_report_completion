			<sentence id="7.1">So, for example, if I want to open delicious in a new tab (I use keywords on bookmarks) I will type:
On Firefox 2: (Ctrl + t) delicious (enter)
On Firefox 2 (Full Screen): (Ctrl + t) delicious (enter)
On Firefox 3: (Ctrl + t) delicious (enter)
On Firefox 3 (FS): (Ctrl + t) (Alt + d) delicious (enter)</sentence>
