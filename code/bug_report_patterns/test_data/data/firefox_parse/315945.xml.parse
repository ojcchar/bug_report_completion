			<sentence id="2.1">After updating to 1.5RC1, i've noticed that both context menus and menus from the menubar (with Default theme) looks too "flat", without the classic Win32 3D border, that was there on Firefox 1.0.7 and earlier.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Also, when i move the mouse over the menu, instead to see a 3D effect like earlier Firefox versions (a border draw around the menu), it highlights on blue.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">This really looks ugly, at least for me.</sentence>
