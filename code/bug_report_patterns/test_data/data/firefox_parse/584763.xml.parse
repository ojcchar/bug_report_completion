			<sentence id="2.1">Top bar, tab bar, menu bar...all messed up. You can clearly see iTunes behind it, and the top menu header looks like it's floating...and, looks to have reverted back to Vista basic style. After i installed beta 2 the other day, i chose to be in private mode all the time. But, after some lag issues with a flash game - i thought that maybe that would be causing it. So, when i unchecked the box to remember history - and, do custom settings, i restarted. Allowed Firefox process to stop - which i thought had quit - tried to open again, said it was still running and i had to quit the process or wait. Waited a few more minutes, opened up - finally opened after a short minute or 2 lag....and, that's how it opened. Messed up looking</sentence>
