			<sentence id="3.1">A slight problem I have noticed after upgrading to Firefox 3.5:
When I open Firefox, the window appears and loads homepage (google) as I would expect.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">However the window loses focus after a few milliseconds and then Firefox is no longer the active window.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">This then means that I have to click on the firefox window to make it become active.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">The problem becomes weirder if I already have an instance of firefox open and then try to open another instance of firefox (either by clicking File&gt;NewWindow, pressing CRTL+N, or by clicking a shortcut to the program on my desktop or start menu).</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">If I try to open a new instance, it opens, loads google, and then instantaneously flips the focus back to the original instance of FF.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">Weird!</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">This may seem like a trivial glitch but it is irritating when I open Firefox and my cursor is not in the search for Google, which is usually what I open FF for in a hurry.</sentence>
