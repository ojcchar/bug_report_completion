	<title>Double-click in blank space to open a new tab</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Double-clicking the background in TabCandy currently does nothing.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">It might be nice if it opened a new tab in the position I clicked.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">This would be more convenient than dragging open a new tab group there and clicking its (pretty small) new tab button, and unlike the large global new tab button it would allow me to position the new tab right away.</sentence>
