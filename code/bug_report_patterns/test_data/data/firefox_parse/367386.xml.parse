	<title>Complex queries only return visited places</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Complex queries (queries which are not simple bookmark folder lookups) add "visit_count &gt; 0" to the sql select statement (except when the query uses an annotation).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">This may be a common case for history searches, but when searching for bookmarks it is incorrect.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Thus, it should be configurable.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Furthermore, one should be able to query for a particular range of visit_count, not just &gt; 0.</sentence>
