		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Working on another bug (bug 595943), I discovered that it's possible for xul:tabs to have both .</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">pinned and .</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">hidden true.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">They're still visible in this state (evidently pinned takes precedence), but it's possible they behave badly in other ways.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">So I guess there's really two issues here: Panorama should never put tabs in that state, and also it probably shouldn't even be possible to do so.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This bug is for the former; bug 597218 is for the latter.</sentence>
