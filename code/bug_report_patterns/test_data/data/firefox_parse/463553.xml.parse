	<title>Add tabs to the Clear Recent History dialog box</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">The difference between browser history and session data exists primarily on an implementation level, and not necessarily inside of the user's mind (unless the user has been involved with Firefox development.)</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I think we should add tabs to the Clear Recent History dialog, since clearing all information from a particular time period, but leaving certain tabs open from that time period is counter intuitive.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Another issues is how the Clear Recent History dialog relates to private browsing mode:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Something that I am worried about is that the user opens several embarrassing
tabs, and then opens up private browsing mode.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">As the start page suggestions,
they clear their recent history using the Clear Recent History dialog.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">Of
course, history isn't the same thing as active tabs (in the implementation
model, but not the user's mental model), so these embarrassing tabs are
persisted in the previous session.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">The user eventually closes down Firefox,
and leaves.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.5">The next person to load Firefox will see the sensitive tabs, even
though the user thought they were taking every action they needed to in order
to cover their tracks.</sentence>
