			<sentence id="5.1">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">There is no known reliable way to reproduce the problem.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.3">It *seems* to be</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.4">related to network load.</sentence>

			<sentence id="5.13">Clicking on any link, selecting a bookmark, clicking on STOP or</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.14">RELOAD, does nothing to resolve the problem.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.15">No matter what you do (even if you</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.16">have multiple Firebird windows open) will allow you to browse to any other page.</sentence>

If a link cannot be resolved correct, an error should be generated.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">If a link cannot be resolved in time, an error should be generated.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.3">Regardless of cause, the user should be able to click on any other link, select
a bookmard, or RELOAD the page successfully.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.4">When Firebird is closed, there
should be no remaining zombie threads.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">At times, the problem happens more frequently.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.2">It is possible this is due to
network load on my PC.</sentence>

Firebird.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.4">I have tried many different versions (both standard and optimized)
and the problem remains.</sentence>
