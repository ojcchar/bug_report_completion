	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When middle-clicking on back/forward/reload, while an AppTab is the current tab, the new tab will also be an AppTab.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">This came as a surprise - I'd expect the new tab to be a normal tab, as every other action opens a normal tab.</sentence>
