	<title>Link location can be spoofed in status bar using onclick</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">As exemplified with the following code:</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.1">&amp;lt;body onUnload="if(flag)location.href='http://slashdot.org'"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href="http://www.google.com" onMouseOver="window.status='test'"
onClick="flag=true"&amp;gt;testing&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.1">the location that a link will take you to can be spoofed.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">The onMouseOver event
is there to show that even with the preference to disable scripts from changing
status bar text turned off, Firefox doesn't allow this to change the status bar.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="3.3">However, clicking this link will take you to http://slashdot.org, while the
status bar will indicate that it will take you to http://www.google.com.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">This
doesn't work in Internet Explorer, as in, it will still take you to
http://www.google.com.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.5">My guess is that this is due to the order in which the
browser responds to the onClick event.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.6">Perhaps a tags should not honor onClick
events if there is an external URL in the href attribute.</sentence>
