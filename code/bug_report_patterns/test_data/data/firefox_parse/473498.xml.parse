			<sentence id="2.1">When managing a large list of saved passwords, it's sometimes difficult to find a particular entry.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This is due to variances of the inclusion of (and flavor of) the protocol (http:// https://), and of the "www."</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">, or "secure."</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">or other, before the 2nd-level domain name.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">It would be very helpful if the user could filter these based on a partial match of the "site" displayed.</sentence>

			<sentence id="4.1">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">1 Have a large list of saved passwords, for many different web sites, such that:</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">a. the site names recorded vary by starting with http://, https://, and lacking such a prefix;</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">b. the site names recorded include various 3rd-level domains ("www."</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.5">, "secure."</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.6">, etc.) and some exclude them</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.7">2 Have a user unfamiliar with the data search for the username for several random sites, using their "common" name (americanexpress.com, etc.)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Expected Results:  
If there were a filter available, the user could type only the 2nd-level domain name, wait a moment, and for typical use cases, would be presented with a filtered list just a few entries long.</sentence>
