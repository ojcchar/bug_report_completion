	<title>Conditional formatting: Use better text styles by default</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Thanks for the new conditional formatting dialog.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I would like to suggest two small enhancement requests which improve usability with regards to cell styles for conditions:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">(a):
It would be good if the cell style which is selected by default in the dialog is not the style named "Default", but rather the style in the list named "Result".</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Suggestion: Set the style "Result" as style selected by default for conditions in the dialog.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Rationale of this request: 100% of users want to choose a style which is different from the default cell style, because they want to see the result of conditional formatting in their sheet.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">(b)</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">Please add two more cell styles to the list of cell styles in the dialog which are very commonly used by users:</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">* Style "Positive values (green font colour)" and</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">* Style "Negative values (red font colour)"</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.5">Rationale of this request: From all spreadsheets using conditional formatting I have see so far, the vast majority of sheets just marks positive and negative values.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.6">The set-up of this in Calc is a bit cumbersome, because everyone needs to define two new cell styles when they simply want to mark values &gt;=0 and &lt;0</sentence>
