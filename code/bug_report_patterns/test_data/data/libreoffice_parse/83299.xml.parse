	<title>Format &gt; Sections is disabled when the cursor is inside a protected section (Word type form fields protected document)</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I have a document which is, in its entirety, a write-protected section (it contains a fillable form, but the form itself cannot be modified).</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I wanted to adjust the form, which according to the official help (https://help.libreoffice.org/Writer/Editing_Sections) is done by going to Format &gt; Sections, finding the appropriate section, and unchecking the write-protection.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">However, when inside a protected section, the Format &gt; Section menu entry is disabled; and since the document is a write-protected section in its entirety, there is no way to place the cursor into an area which is modifiable.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">I would expect the Format &gt; Section to be always enabled.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">An loosely related enhancement suggestion would be to make the "read-only" message in the notification bar (at the bottom) right-clickable (or something similar) to remove write-protection quickly.</sentence>
