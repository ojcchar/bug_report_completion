	<title>Avoid using Ctrl-Alt (AltGr) combinations for keyboard shortcuts</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I suggest that combinations of Ctrl-Alt (= AltGr) with alphanumeric keys should not be used for default keyboard shortcuts on Windows platforms, because many national keyboard layouts use such combinations to return characters or as dead keys.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">The use of such combinations is a particular annoyance due to bug 35017, which currently makes it impossible to permanently delete/change keyboard shortcuts.</sentence>
