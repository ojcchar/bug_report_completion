Standard filter</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Access to the "standard filter" (which is rather an overview of the current setup) is possible from the autofilter overlay widget or via menu: data &gt; more filters &gt; standard filter.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Issues:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">1 The dialog has no means to remove rows.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">So when you want to configure the filter it cannot be done here (although it is possible to add more filters).</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">Likely the row is not applied when field name is "-none-".</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">I suggest to add buttons to add new and delete exisiting filters.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">2 The dialog is badly sized and cannot made smaller (running on LibO fresh on KDE).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">3 When the current filter contains of many lengthy items, which can easily happen for text, the value input grows to a length above real screen estate.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">I suggest to cut the text with ellipsis.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">4 The OR condition is questionable since OR usually requires brackets.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.2">The evaluationn of &lt;foo&gt; AND &lt;bar&gt; OR &lt;baz&gt; AND &lt;qux&gt; is not straightforward.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.3">Dropping OR would be the easiest solution.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.4">But probably not the best.</sentence>
