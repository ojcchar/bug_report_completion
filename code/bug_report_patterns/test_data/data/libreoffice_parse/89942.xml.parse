	<title>Draw created shapes fail to copy into Writer properly.</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I've experienced two major defects when copying DRAW created shapes into a Writer document.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">(Using LO 4.4.0.3 in Win7)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">1 When a single shape (circle, rectangle) is copy/pasted from Draw to Writer, it appears to transfer properly, but is missing (deleted) when Writer document reloaded.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This happens whether the shape is placed on the page or in a frame.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Note:	a) If two or more DRAW shapes are grouped then copied, the problem does not occur.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">b) Lines and connectors never exhibit this problem, just circles, rectangles etc.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">c) A shape originally created in Writer, copied to Draw, then copied back to Writer does not cause any problems.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">2 When objects created in Draw are grouped then copied into a Writer frame, the circles and rectangles always remain in the background.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.7">This means that unless the frame area has Transparency= 100%, the objects may be obscured (at first I thought missing).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.8">Note:	a) Lines and connectors never exhibit this problem, just circles, rectangles etc.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.9">b) A shape originally created in Writer, copied to Draw, then copied back to Writer does not cause any problems.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">I'm evaluating LibreOffice as a replacement for MS Office and defects such as this are quite alarming and tarnish the first impression of LO.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">In this case there is a workaround, but it took a bit of searching/testing to figure it out, and could easily put off a new user.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">A permanent fix would greatly improve the new-adopter experience.</sentence>
