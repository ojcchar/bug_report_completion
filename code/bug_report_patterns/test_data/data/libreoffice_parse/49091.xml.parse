	<title>UI: Alt-Left, Alt-Right keyboard shortcuts ineffective</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Just spent 20 minutes getting very confused as to why I couldn't assign the Navigation controls "Back" and "Forward" to a keyboard shortcut.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Had a nice long bug report all typed up for it, but before posting tried different shortcuts...</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Sure enough, I could assign them to Alt-B and Alt-F, but not Alt-Left and Alt-Right :p</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">A little more experimenting and it seems that no matter what one assigns to these combinations, all that happens is the cursor moves left and right completely normally: their shortcut function isn't activated at all.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">I haven't upgraded to the 5.x series yet for a number of reasons (including Bug 47764 and Bug 46155) so I'd appreciate if someone else could check that this bug still exists in the newest versions :-)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Steps to reproduce: In LibreOffice Writer:</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">1 Go to the Tools menu &gt; Customize...</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.3">2 If not selected, select the Keyboard tab</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.4">3 Assign some (any) function to the Alt-Left and Alt-Right key combinations</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.5">4 Return to your document</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.6">5 Test the Alt-Left and Alt-Right keyboard shortcuts</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.7">*Result: No effect: shortcut functions not activated*</sentence>
