			<sentence id="1.1">Created attachment 61110
Test case described in the bug report.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">When a Master Document includes multiple embedded documents that contain ordered lists, the first ordered list is numbered properly, but lists in subsequent embedded documents are misnumbered, or numbered when they are supposed to be bulleted lists.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">This error occurs when the Master Document is first opened, importing its embedded documents.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">But if you then open the Navigator and update the embedded documents whose lists are rendered incorrectly, then these same lists are rendered correctly (without changing anything in the source documents).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">The attached zip file contains a sample master document (TestMasterDoc.odm) that imports three source documents (Chapter 1.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">odt, Chapter 2.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">odt, and Chapter 3.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">odt), each of which contains a list.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.5">Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 contain ordered lists, while Chapter 3 contains a bulleted list.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Just open the master document and you will see that the first ordered list is correct, but the lists in Chapters 2 and 3 are wrong.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Then open the Navigator panel and update Chapter 2, and you will see that its ordered list is now corrected.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">Update Chapter 3, and you will see that its bulleted list is corrected.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">This is a very tiresome bug because it means that every time I open a master document because of revisions in embedded source documents, I have to then open the Navigator and update every source document that contains a list.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.2">I am using the master document facility to manage books with dozens of chapters, so it is a very tedious process to make up for this glaring bug.</sentence>
