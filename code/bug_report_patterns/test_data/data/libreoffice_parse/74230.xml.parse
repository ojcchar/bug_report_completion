			<sentence id="2.1">After having updated from 4.1 to 4.2.0.4 (which I can't choose in the Version field above), Writer shows all lines in a document (several dozens that introduce structure in tables) that were formerly black now as blue (see attachment) This is annoying because an update shouldn't require me to change things like that and which is particularly annoying because Writer doesn't allow to highlight several things at the same time (with Shift or Ctrl) so I have to do each line separately.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Seriously, I like LO and proselytize my students all the time, but crap like this make one wonder why with each update x bugs get fixed and y bugs get introduced ...</sentence>
