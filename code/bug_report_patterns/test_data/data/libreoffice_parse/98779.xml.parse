	<title>UI: "single action" save icon doesn't give a hint of the document status</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">tested under Win8.1 x64 using LibO 5.1.0.3, 5.1.1.3 and recent 5.2.0.0 daily build.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">this issue is quite similar to:
Bug 96590 - UI: save icon does not give a hint of the document status</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">however while Bug 96590 referred to the new save "split button" and was fixed by the design team with an icon modification, this problem still exist for the old "single action" save button.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">in order to enable the "single action" save icon and replace the "split button" save icon (which is now default in 5.1.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">x) you should tweak the expert configuration:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Advanced "Expert Configuration" session and searching for "SaveToolbarController"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">then edit the "controller" string replacing</sentence>

		<paragraph id="9">
			<sentence id="9.1">"com.sun.star.comp.framework.GenericPopupToolbarController"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="10">
			<sentence id="10.1">on LibreOffice restart, restores the non-split button behavior to the Toolbar "Save" button.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="11">
			<sentence id="11.1">this way you can restore the old "single action" button from 5.0.x and previous LibO releases.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="12">
			<sentence id="12.1">the only problem is that unlike older realeases, the "greyed" out effect that involved the icon after clicking the Save icon for a modified existing file is no longer present.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="13">
			<sentence id="13.1">the "greyed out" effect was a useful visual hint to let the user know when a document was modified and needed saving.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="14">
			<sentence id="14.1">actually the "split button" features 2 different icons to let the user know if the document needs saving.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="15">
			<sentence id="15.1">I don't know what technically gave the greyed out effect in 5.0.x (was it a separate icon or just a processing of the normal icon?)</sentence>
			<sentence id="15.2">but I think a similar thing should be done for the "single action" button as well.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="16">
			<sentence id="16.1">I set status to NEW since this problem has been already confirmed by another user here: https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98730#c32</sentence>
