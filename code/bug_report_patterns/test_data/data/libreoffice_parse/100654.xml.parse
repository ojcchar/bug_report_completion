			<sentence id="1.2">Reference manager Mendeley was working fine in LO 5.1.2, but after updating to 5.1.3.2 there seems to work only partially:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.7">
The plugin is working, I see the tool bar and the "Insert citation" option is available, but after selecting the reference the legend "Formatting citation" appears and does not goes further.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">It is supposed to load the reference in an specified format from my library.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Uninstalling and reinstalling the plugin did not solve it, neither was resetting the user folder in LibreOffice.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">Any help is welcome.</sentence>
