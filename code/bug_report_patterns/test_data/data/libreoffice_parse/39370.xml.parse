	<title>RTL / LTR and right/left alignment buttons' icons should not be reversed in RTL interface</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When using an LTR interface (such as English), the RTL/LTR toolbar buttons have arrows pointing to the left (for LTR) and to the right (for RTL), which is the correct behaviour.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">However, when switching to an RTL interface (such as Hebrew) the buttons' icons are reversed.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">This is wrong, please do not swap the buttons' icons in RTL mode.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Thanks.</sentence>
