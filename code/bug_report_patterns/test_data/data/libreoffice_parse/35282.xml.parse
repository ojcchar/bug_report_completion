	<title>tools-&gt;language-&gt;for_all_text fails to override style language settings, spellcheck fails as result</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">My issue is that after changing settings a bit, LibreOffice would suddenly no longer do any sort of spell-checking.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I installed dictionaries, extensions, etc..</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Nothing would work, not even clearing the user profile or changing Tools-Options-Language Settings defaults would fix  it.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I reproduced this problem under Windows 7 and Ubuntu Maverick 10.10 so it's highly likely to be a platform-generic bug.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">The problem started happening about 1 week ago, I reinstalled LibreOffice, tried OpenOffice, they both had the same bug.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">And 3.3.2 RC1 has the same bug, it's my current version.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Basically, the result is that no spellchecking at all would work.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">I use two languages, English-Canada and French-Canada.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">And both failed to spellcheck.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">I would click the spell-check button and it would give this:</sentence>

		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">As you can see, there's no language set and spellcheck did nothing.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">However, the normal way to fix this would be to use Tools-Language-For All Text-English (Canada).</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.3">I did it and it didn't change anything.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.4">Same issue when I try "For this paragraph".</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.5">It doesn't remember the setting :</sentence>

			<sentence id="6.1">http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/2342/foralltextenglish.png</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">However, thanks to someone's tip and a crapload of perseverance (http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.user/3145), I realized I accidentally put the default font to Language=None.</sentence>

		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="9">
			<sentence id="9.1">Oddly enough, if I selected the whole text and went to "This selection"- English (Canada), it would suddenly work and underline in red typos:</sentence>
		</paragraph>

		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="11">
			<sentence id="11.1">So as you can see, the bug is that if you have a default font language set to "None" in my example, using "This Text" should override it or outright change the default to English (Canada).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="12">
			<sentence id="12.1">I know it being set to "None" a bit silly but it's also do-able if set to another language.</sentence>
			<sentence id="12.2">For example, I'm French and I set the default font to French (Canada).</sentence>
			<sentence id="12.3">Now, "This selection" is checked at French (Canada).</sentence>
			<sentence id="12.4">When I click "This Text"-English (Canada), it fails to change it to English (Canada) and keeps the spellcheck at French (Canada) unless I change it manually through "This selection" or re-change the default font.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="13">
			<sentence id="13.1">I believe this to be a fairly important bug for any user who will use documents with different languages as it's mind-boggling to try changing the language and see the spellcheck remain the same so I put the severity at "Major".</sentence>
