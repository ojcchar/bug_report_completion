lo hyperlink dialog</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.1">It seems most of the button labels in the Hyperlink dialog are misleading, so let me explain the expected functionality behind standard button labels:
The standard is for "Apply" to apply the changes and leave the dialog open, "OK" to apply the changes and close the dialog, "Close" to close the dialog (should be used when changes are applied automatically), "Cancel" to revert changes made and close the dialog, "Undo" to go a single step back in history, "Back" to navigate to the last visited screen.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">So, in terms of the current hyperlink dialog:</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">* There should be two buttons instead of the current "Apply": "Apply" and "OK", working as described above.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">* "Close" should be renamed to "Cancel"</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">* "Back" should be renamed to "Revert" ("Undo" doesn't quite fit the bill, as the button doesn't go through each step in history); however, IMHO it'd be good to remove this button -- it does the same thing as Cancel, only without closing the dialog.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.5">Operating System: All</sentence>
