			<sentence id="2.1">When using a template with "click to add text" boxes in it, I start typing.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">When I have filled up the box, I expect the the text to start shrinking to allow me to continue writing.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">But currently the cursor and current text disappear off the bottom of the text box and I can't see what I'm typing and can't see the cursor.</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">It seems that sometimes I can trigger the text to resize, eg by typing "sss" then three backspaces, then enter.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">Pushing a new line of text in this way seems to trigger a redraw and resize.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">But other than annoying tricks like this I have found no way to work around this at all.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">This bug is in the official Ubuntu 12.04 LTS version of LibreOffice.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">Tell me if you want me to report the bug on Launchpad instead.</sentence>
