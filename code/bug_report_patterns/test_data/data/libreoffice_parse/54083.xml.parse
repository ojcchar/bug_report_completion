			<sentence id="2.1">The status text in the splash screen is dislocated and partially lies outside the client area of the splash screen.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This is caused by the windows readability option allowing 100%, 125% and 150% zoom of fonts, altering textheight.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Sometimes the position of components inside a window is also affected.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">To fix this, the "scaled" property of the parent window must be set to false.</sentence>
