	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">

			<sentence id="1.2">1 right click</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">2 select "paste special" (this opens a dialog window)</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">3 deselect "insert all"</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">4 select "numbers"</sentence>

		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I would like something like :</sentence>

		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">This would split the current "selection" group of checkboxes into subgroups :</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">- "values" (with a group checkbox)</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">- "extra data" (with a group checkbox)</sentence>

		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">On first use by default the "values" could be selected and the "extra data" could be deselected.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">This would allow something that would satisfy former M. Excel users :</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">1 right click</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">2 select "paste special"</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.5">3 validate on "OK" button (since the "values" was selected and "extra data" was deselected).</sentence>
