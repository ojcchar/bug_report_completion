	<title>LibO won't close on Windows occasionally</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Occasionally, on Windows 7 and Windows 10, and with LO 4.5 (and probably earlier) and now also 5.0.2.2, LibreOffice (be it Writer, or Draw, or presumably any other component), will refuse to close on clicking the windows "X" button in the top right.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">So the user has to force close the program through the task manager.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">I don't know what causes this, but it is not always the case (probably less than 10% of times).</sentence>
