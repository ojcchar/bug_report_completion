	<title>UI: System font DPI settings fails to affect some UI text, eg. sheet names</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Problem description: Some of the user interface text does not scale when the system-wide font DPI settings are changed (example use-case:  working with hi-DPI displays)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">1 Configure system to use a font DPI higher than the standard 96.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">I'm using 130 to account for my 14" laptop screen that's 1600x900px.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">I'm also using KDE (Kubuntu) and changing the setting with "System settings" &gt; "Application Appearance" &gt; "Fonts" &gt; "Force fonts DPI"</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">2 Launch LibreOffice and notice that most of the interface text is larger after upping the DPI.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">For example, all application menus look larger as expected, and the 100% zoom shows the spreadsheet content larger than with the default system DPI settings.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.7">3 However, observe that the following user interface text is still small and has not changed after the system DPI change: sheet labels (at the bottom of each sheet), text within the auto-filter dialog, text within the "Apply style" toolbar utility.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.8">(There may be other places, but these are ones that I've noticed).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Fortunately my monitor isn't as dense as some (the Dell XPS 15 touch is almost 250!)</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">, so I can still read this small text on my Lenovo T420s, but I imagine that preparing LibreOffice for hi-DPI displays like this will become increasingly important as they begin to penetrate the market further.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">Operating System: Ubuntu
Version: 4.2.3.3 release</sentence>
