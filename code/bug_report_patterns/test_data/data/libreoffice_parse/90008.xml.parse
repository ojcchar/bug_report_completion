	<title>reliable way to move entry between dictionaries</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">If a user has multiple dictionaries, moving an entry from one to another should be with a button, not by hand-copying and risking making it wrong.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">If there are not multiple dictionaries that are user-writable, the button would just be clutter, so it should be invisible.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I'm told this version of LibreOffice is at the end of its life (EOL) but I've since gotten an automatic update to it with Fedora 20 Linux.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">However, if a newer version of LibreOfice has this, that's good enough.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">I don't want to parallel-install it if Fedora is not sending it.</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">I've guessed my hardware.</sentence>
