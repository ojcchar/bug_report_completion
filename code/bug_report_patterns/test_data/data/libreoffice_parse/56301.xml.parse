	<title>Allow user to edit document with Insert Special Characters open</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I'm a recent convert from Word, and I love most of the features of LO.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">However, I would like to request some changes to the "Insert Special Character" dialog.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">In Word a character isn't entered until the user double-clicks (which I like for the sake of confirmation), and furthermore the user can click off the window, continue editing the document, and insert a special character in a completely different location.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I don't like having to open the dialog every time I need a new character, which can happen a lot in my case.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">At least, could the user be given the power to edit the characters they are inserting freely, rather than just deleting them all at once?</sentence>
