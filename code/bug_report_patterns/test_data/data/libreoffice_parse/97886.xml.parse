			<sentence id="1.2">the actual png files are not multiplied, but some get referenced many, many times in content.xml.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">just opening and saving the file adds two new such references.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">editing and saving over a longer period of time increases this amount.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">after getting hundreds of thousands of such references, writer stops opening the file, essentially corrupting it beyond usefulness.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.6">manually editing out the duplicate image references allows to edit and save the file a few more times.</sentence>
