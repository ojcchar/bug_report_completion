			<sentence id="1.2">Write the formula =B2 into cell B3
Write the formula =COUNTBLANK(B2:B3) into cell A1.</sentence>

			<sentence id="1.4">Seen result: A1 shows number 2.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">The content of cell B3 is a formula, therefore it is not empty and may not be counted.</sentence>
