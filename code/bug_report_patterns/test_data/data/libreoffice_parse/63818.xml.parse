	<title>FORMATTING: Crashing after unifying and centering</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Problem description: 
I've been accidentally unifying all the cells of a certain row and then I wrote something inside the resulting cell.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Of course, when trying to center the words inside the resulting cell, LibreOffice crashed.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">The reason is obvious: impossible to calculate the exact center of an infinite width cell.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">1 right click on a row number (left side of the screen)</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">2 select "unify" cells</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">3 write something inside the resulting cell and then align center it</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Current behavior:
crash</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Expected behavior:
not to crash.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">Maybe just centering the word beyond the limits of the current view or beyond the limits of the last wrote cell on the right side.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">Operating System: Ubuntu
Version: 3.6.2.2 release</sentence>
