			<sentence id="2.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">[1] Create a short text document with at least one heading.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">[2] Create a table of contents.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">[3] Enable option &#x201C;LibreOffice &gt; Security &gt; Security Options and warnings &gt; Options... &gt; Security options &gt; Crtl-click required to follow hyperlinks&#x201D;.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">[4] Disable option &#x201C;LibreOffice Writer &gt; Formatting Aids &gt; Cursor in protected areas&#x201D;</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">[5] Move cursor over an item of the table of contents.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.7">A tip is displayed: &#x201C;Ctrl-click to open hyperlink: ...&#x201D;.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.8">This message is wrong.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.9">It is not a hyperlink, it is a link inside the document.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.10">But this is not the real problem...</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.11">[6] Ctrl+click on item of table of content.</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.13">No data loss in my tries, recovery works as expected.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">If you disable the option &#x201C;... &gt; Ctrl-click required to follow hyperlinks&#x201D; in step [2], then in step [4] only the heading name is displayed.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">Better would be: &#x201C;Click in order to go to heading 'heading name'&#x201D; or similar.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">In this case a click on an item of the table also crashes LibreOffice.</sentence>
