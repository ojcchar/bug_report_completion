			<sentence id="2.1">Hi,</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">I really like to use open source software like libreoffice.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">But it's still so ugly on a Mac.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Here some examples (look at the screenshot attached):</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">1 Why is there such an ugly line?</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">remove the bright one, so it's consistent with the left content window (above the ruler)</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">2 why is there such a fat border just to collapse the view?</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.5">Wouldn't it be better to have a little pin at the top right edge of the whole view?</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.6">And to show it again, everyone knows what a menubar is and to look under "View" ...</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.7">3 Why are all comboboxes, textboxes and dropdown boxes so f*****g ugly?</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.8">Why all the grey stuff in the middle.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.9">It looks like you really just put it together in 5 minutes and never touched it again.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.10">It must be possible to either draw the grey everywhere or make it transparent?</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.11">4 again a very strange bright line, remove it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.12">And the grey one from the status bar is not going to the window edge, but stops in the nowhere.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.13">5 the little icon is not correctly vertically centered.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.14">And the right padding should be the same as top and bottom.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.15">6 the vertical alignment of the statusbar text is also not perfect.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.16">Could go 1 or 2 pixels up.</sentence>
