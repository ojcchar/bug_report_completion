	<title>FILESAVE: export to word 2003 .doc format formats bibliography entries not appropriately</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When I export ODT from 4.3.6.1 to MS Word 2003 .</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">doc format, all bibliography entries are omitted, either when referenced by numbers or by shortnames (textkey == name of entry).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">When I do the same from 4.0.2.1, bibliography entries are exported as plain text (so, plain [1] or [Name], not special fields).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This isn't ideal (export to "real" Word bib entries would be better), but anyhow is way, way better than the current behaviour, which seems to be a regression.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Importing either .</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">doc goes okay into either 4.0.2.1 or 4.3.6.1, so it's export-related only.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Attached are: two initial ODTs, with bibliography entries displayed by 1) numkeys and 2) textkeys (prepared in 4.3.6.1) and the respective export results (informative filenames).</sentence>
