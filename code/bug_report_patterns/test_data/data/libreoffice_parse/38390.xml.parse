	<title>Please make install-free tarballs of LibreOffice(tm)</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Packages of LibreOffice for Linux come in two basic flavors, rpm and deb.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">While this probably covers most usage scenarios, this prevents the use of bleeding edge versions of LibreOffice where an older, stable version is available via the Linux distribution's package repositories.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Using the newer version would result in a de-installation of the stable version, which is not what one would want if the purpose is mostly to trial or try out the features of the new version (and also to help out with the bug reporting).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">By default, Mozilla's official Firefox download binaries are distro-agnostic.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Being "tarballs", they can be unpacked and run straight away without the need to install them in the usual system directories (/usr).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">This makes it easy to "uninstall" Firefox via a simple rm -fR $Firefox_Folder.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">Users can thus run the latest Firefox without worrying whether they would overwrite or worse nuke their stable system.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Opera also offers run-in-place tarballs for Linux, which have the added feature of having their config files located within the runtime directory (under the unpacked Opera folder).</sentence>
