	<title>EDITING: spell check -- no way to get to spell check dialogue if no errors detected.</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When the spell checker finds no errors, there is no (obvious) way to get to the spell check options or help buttons.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">When the spell checker finds no errors, the spell-check window pops up, but on top of it (and blocking), a second popup appears which informs that spell check is complete.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">While the second popup is open, there is no way to check 'options' or 'help' on the main spell check window.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">When you close the second popup, the main spell check window automatically closes.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">This is especially a problem if the spell checker is in a (broken) state where it refuses to find errors ( yes -- different bug, un-filed as of yet -- seems to occur when English (Can) dictionary is chosen).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Possible solutions:</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">1 include a button on the popup which says 'keep spell check window open'.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">2 require the user to close the main spell check window separately/manually</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">3 have the 'spell check complete' message occur inside of the main window.</sentence>
