	<title>text and image loss in PDF to PNG conversion</title>

			<sentence id="1.1">Created attachment 79311
original pdf and converted pdf image</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.1">Problem description: </sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I work in an existing document (created by someone else under windows in word with already a foto and an image in it), where I add some data and add a signature from a file jpg </sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Save as odt or doc, there is no difference for the effect.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">Convert to pdf pressing the icon "pdf"</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">The pdf document is ok.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">Convert pdf document in image, because the signature must obviously be part of the document and not an image.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.7">In the converted "pdf-image"-document, part of the content (the part written in italic and what's written at the bottom of the page, the already existing image and foto, but not the signature) is missing!</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.8">Creating a new document with image in it in libreoffice, nothing of this happens, the converted file is exactly as the original file!</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.9">Creating a document with text and foto and other image (jpg and png) in virtual old word and working on it in libre office, everything remains ok. So it must have to do with something that happens on the other persons computer, and I will ask them, but I fear they will know nothing to answer. Apparently their document is perfectly ok when it comes to me by e-mail, so I'm at a loss. Working with that document (saved with other names and other images) in the past in other versions (openoffice), nothing like that happened.</sentence>

			<sentence id="5.1">It was done with some 3.6 version as you see, but it still happens with the new 4.0.3.3, though the new files I created and tried out and which didn't have problems were only done under 4.0.3.3
