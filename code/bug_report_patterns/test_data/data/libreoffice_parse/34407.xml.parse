	<title>support bidirectional slide transitions according to previous/next moves</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">With some slide transitions, especially the cools 3d opengl, (really tnx for the awesome work!)</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">would be very useful to "reverse" the transitions effect while moving to the previous slide.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">This really helps to visually understand in what direction the presentation is going to.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I don't know if internally (speaking about the code) all transitions could be easy "reverted", maybe, even in this optimistic situation, this behaviour could be automatic or the user could be glad to "check" a "Reverse with previous slide" option.</sentence>

tnx again
