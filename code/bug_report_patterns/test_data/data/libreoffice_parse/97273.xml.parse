	<title>EDITING accentuated characters out of place (French)</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Hello,</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I am experiencing an issue with Writer (LibreOffice 5.0.3.2) on my OS X 10.8.5 machine.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I am afraid this might be rather difficult to reproduce, as it is related to speed of typing: I am using Writer to take notes during classes, and so typing rather fast (at least as fast as I can...) in French language.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">When I type, any character with an accent tends to be out of place, usually one row left of where it should be (so I guess you could say "early").</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">Depending on the speed, the accentuated character can sometimes be two rows out of its typing place.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">This is not systematic, and I had dismissed it at first as being the occasional typo on my part, but yesterday I was in class with a particularly fast speaking lecturer, and it became a real handicap.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">I performed the following test in order to objectively demonstrate the presence of this bug: I installed a keylogger (I know I know, evil, but in this case, a perfectly legitimate use), then typed into Writer.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">Here is the comparison:</sentence>

			<sentence id="5.1">Keylogger:
Les soci&#xE9;t&#xE9;s am&#xE9;rindiennes sont m&#xE9;tis&#xE9;es.</sentence>

Les soc&#xE9;it&#xE9;s am&#xE9;rindiennes sont m&#xE9;t&#xE9;ises.</sentence>
