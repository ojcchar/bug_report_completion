			<sentence id="2.1">Visible separators are being used in the toolbars next to drop down menu and value controls when space is needed between it and the next button or control.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This is evident in the formatting toolbar with the separators between font style, font name, font size.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">What is really needed is an invisible separator to provide the necessary spacing between these toolbar elements, as the separator is a means of separating elements that arent closely related to each other.</sentence>
