	<title>Paste Special -&gt; Formatted Text[RTF] doesn't handle table data correctly</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When copying and pasting special from Calc into Writer - if one chooses "Formatted text[RTF]" as Paste Special option - a table is created in the Writer document.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">That is good.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">However, if one copies a number of cells from Calc, then selects the same number of cells in an existing Writer table, and does a Paste Special -&gt; Formatted Text[RTF] - the data is not pasted correctly across all selected cells - but rather a new table is created in the first cell of the selection.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">When copying from the spreadsheet program to the text processing program of Another Office Suite, if the same number of cells is selected at both ends (provided they are lined up in the same configuration rows/columns wise) - the paste process is smart enough and it fills them up correctly in the table of the text processing document.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">This feature is used and relied on quite heavily in certain work environments - and its absence creates a lot of additional effort in the workflow.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">It would save a lot of users significant amounts of time if it can be implemented.</sentence>
