	<title>Request for a "smart" link between thesaurus and spell checking</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Introduction: In LibreOffice spell checking and thesaurus are insufficiently linked, which leads to the perception that LibreOffice spell check is insufficient.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">This problem can be easily solved: Therefore, this bug is marked as [EasyHack]</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Problem description:</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">1 Language dictionaries for spell checking generally contain official and not-very-colloquial words.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">That's okay, so far.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">2 The thesaurus additionally also includes many words which are colloquial and non-official.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">That's okay, too.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">3 However, if the user writes a colloquial word in a document (which is in the thesaurus), spell check will not find it and therefore will underline it in red.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.7">If the user then just performs a right mouse click on the word, he/she will usually get offered quite useless alternative words which do not really fit.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.8">The user does NOT see that the inbuilt thesaurus knows the word and could actually offer much better alternatives.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.9">The user just thinks that LibreOffice does not know this word, which is wrong.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Proposal: If the spell check does not know a particular word, but the thesaurus knows it, LibreOffice should include the note "The thesaurus offers alternatives to this word" as first entry of the proposed alternative words after performing a right mouse click on the red underlined word.</sentence>
