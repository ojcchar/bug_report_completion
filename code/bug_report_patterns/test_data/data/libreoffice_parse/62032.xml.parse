		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">1 Tools-Outline numbering: Set "paragraph style" to (none) in first 3 levels</sentence>

			<sentence id="8.1">You can confirm this in the attachment, where the proof is even more evident because I set the prefix XX to Level 1 in the style Numbering 1.</sentence>
			<sentence id="8.2">It should be applied to H1 only, but it's being applied to H1,H2 and H3!</sentence>
