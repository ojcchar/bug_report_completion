	<title>Timers and idles should have programmer comprehensible, unique names</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">We have a lot of Idle and Timer objects inside LibreOffice that drive lots of logic.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">We can associate a const char *pDebugName with these as we create them that really helps during debugging of the scheduler cf.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Idle( const sal_Char *pDebugName = nullptr );
...
    Timer( const sal_Char *pDebugName = nullptr );</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">It would be great to annotate each timer with a short, unique (ideally 10-15chars or less) C string that briefly describes it.</sentence>
