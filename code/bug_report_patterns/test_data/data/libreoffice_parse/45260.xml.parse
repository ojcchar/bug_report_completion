	<title>EDITING: Pasted object not same position w.r.t. original object if border thickness greater 0</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When I copy and paste an object, I expect the pasted object to be in the same positionas the original.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">This, however, is not true if the object's border has a thickness greater than 0.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">To reproduce: Draw an ellipse, set border thickness e.g. to 1.00 cm, then copy/paste and the pasted object will be pasted with a shift of -0.5cm/-0.5cm.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">(It's trivial, but this was always one detail why I liked OO/LibO so much more than MS products, so I file it as a minor bug.)</sentence>
