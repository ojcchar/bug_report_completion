Find and Replace with "Special..." button suggestion</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">V Stuart Foote kindly wrote at https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98539#c13 a _trivial_ way to insert an &#x201C;Enter&#x201D;, i.e. &#x201C;
&#x201D;.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Hopefully this implementation of this suggestion will make it even _more_ _trivial_ and would benefit a greater range of users (enterprise, government or otherwise).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">This suggestion extends on the improvements of the &#x201C;Find &amp; Replace&#x201D; dialog box from the resolved bug 98539 enhancement.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Would you please add a &#x201C;_S_pecial&#x2026;&#x201D; drop down (or if not enough screen space it will go up) to the &#x201C;Find &amp; Replace&#x201D; dialog box.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">The &#x201C;_S_pecial&#x2026;&#x201D; button could be located between the &#x201C;For_m_at&#x2026;&#x201D; and &#x201C;_N_o format&#x201D; buttons.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">When a Special character is selected, the Unicode equivalent could be inserted in the &#x201C;_F_ind&#x201D; or &#x201C;Re_p_lace&#x201D; field (depending on when field has the focus).</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">When Find _A_ll, Find Pre_v_ious, _F_ind Next, _R_eplace, Replace A_l_l buttons are selected the Unicode would be converted to the character in the document.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.3">Another option is to use the &#x201C;
&#x201D; (for &#x201C;Enter&#x201D;) etc that V Stuart Foote kindly wrote about.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="8">
			<sentence id="8.1">A small note: Is there a preference between having an ampersand &#x201C;&amp;&#x201D; or writing out &#x201C;and&#x201D;?</sentence>
			<sentence id="8.2">For example:
Find &amp; Replace
