	<title>Trusted Imports as a starting point for Trusted Builds</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">[Trusted Builds][1] are built by Docker using public Dockerfiles, but there doesn't seem to be matching support for Trusted [Imports][2]. Do all Trusted Build chains have to start with official import images? If so, that seems overly limiting. If not, it seems like a big loophole in the "trust" of a trusted build, since many non-reproducible things might happen in the creation of the base image. I'm not sure what Trusted Imports would look like, since it seems like you could just push the non-reproducible stuff back into the tarball that's getting imported, and things have to get bootstrapped somewhere. It can't be [turtles all the way down][3], but clarification on where the trust starts would be nice.</sentence>
