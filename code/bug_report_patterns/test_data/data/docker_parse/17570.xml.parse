		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">As [commented here](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/14083#issuecomment-119346611) for new Docker networking features.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I am using [docker-hosts](https://github.com/blalor/docker-hosts) which does something similar by adding custom entries for each container into the `/etc/hosts`.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">What I like there is that I am able to define both the short name, but also full domain name, so service `hello` would be available as `hello`, but also as `hello.example.com`.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">So could you add a feature where we could define a domain to be appended to the service?</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">This then allows easier migration from external to internal services and back.</sentence>
