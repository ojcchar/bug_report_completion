		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Working with containers I don't like default names used by docker, because they are hard to remember and also ids.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I need to use `--name` parameter every time, what do you think if by default docker uses the image name as container name?</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">If it's already used it can add a suffix like `redis1` `redis2` etc.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I think it's more predictable and easy to use.</sentence>
