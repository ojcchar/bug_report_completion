	<title>Image Specification v1.0.0 has ambiguities that are very problematic for users of the REST APIs</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">1 - Image ID</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">The spec defines &#x201C;Image ID&#x201D;, but then explains what a layer ID is.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">An image is not a layer - an image is a set of layers (per the definition of &#x201C;Layer&#x201D; in the same document).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">2 - Tag</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">The spec defines &#x201C;Tag&#x201D; as,</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">"A tag serves to map a descriptive, user-given name to any single image ID.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">An image name suffix (the name component after :) is often referred to as a tag as well, though it strictly refers to the full name of an image."</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">a.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">This is ambiguous, because the term &#x201C;image ID&#x201D; is ambiguous, as a result of #1.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">b.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.2">The term &#x201C;full name of an image&#x201D; is ambiguous.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.3">Does it include the namespace?</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.4">The hostname/port of the registry?</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.5">(e.g., when one &#x201C;tags an image into a repository&#x201D;)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="8">
			<sentence id="8.1">3 - Repository</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="9">
			<sentence id="9.1">It is not clear if a repository refers to an image name, or an actual image stored in a registry.</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.2">It is also not clear if the &#x201C;repository&#x201D; is the full image name - including the repository host name - or just the name part preceding the colon at the end of the name.</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.3">It is not clear if the &#x201C;repository&#x201D; includes the &#x201C;namespace&#x201D;.</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.4">In fact, the term &#x201C;namespace&#x201D; is not mentioned in the spec, but it is clearly an important element of an image name - or is it?</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.5">(This is not clear.)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="10">
			<sentence id="10.1">4 - Tagging into a repository</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="11">
			<sentence id="11.1">The image spec does not mention this, but the phrase is used in other documentation, without explanation, and it is not clear what this means, especially given the lack of clarity on what &#x201C;repository&#x201D; means.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="12">
			<sentence id="12.1">5 - Image "name"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="13">
			<sentence id="13.1">This term is used loosely in the spec and in other documentation - including the various REST APIs, and it is highly ambiguous.</sentence>
			<sentence id="13.2">Many REST APIs have &#x201C;name&#x201D; parameters, and it is not clear if the parameter is a repository name, or can include a final tag (with semicolon) or not - and if it can include a registry host as part of the name.</sentence>
			<sentence id="13.3">The term &#x201C;image name&#x201D; really needs to be precisely defined and used consistently throughout the documentation - especially the REST APIs since those APIs are untyped and thus there is ample opportunity for a programmer to get it wrong.</sentence>
