		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">With the old repository we had package "lxc-docker" pointing to latest greatest version and "lxc-docker-1.6.0" etc for specific version.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">With the new repo there is only one package "docker-engine" in the "Packages" file, pointing to 1.8.1 although more versions do exist ( http://apt.dockerproject.org/repo/pool/main/d/docker-engine/ )</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">For automatic use of this repo, like with Chef/Puppet, it is quite handy if you can pin a certain version and later raise that version for automatic upgrades</sentence>
