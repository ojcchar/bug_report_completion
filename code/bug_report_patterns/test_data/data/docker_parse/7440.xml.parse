	<title>Docker cli support docker logs attaching to either stdout or stderr, or redirect to each</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Currently the docker cli "docker logs" merges both stdout and stderr into one stream, however there might be cases you only want one of them or want to be able to distinguish them.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I'd like to either have an option to only attach to one of them, or ideally redirect docker's stdout to stdout and docker's stderr to stderr just as the docker run -a stdout -a stderr.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The reason I don't want to use docker run -a since I want to run docker run as detached mode.</sentence>
