	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Running a container from an image built from a Dockerfile with the `EXPOSE` command, Docker throws a message that exposing ports has been deprecated and the `-p` switch should be used.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Deprecation for me means, it is still allowed to be used and is going to be removed in the future.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Either the message needs an update or it is really a regression.</sentence>
