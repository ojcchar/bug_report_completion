	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When application is running within a container, there's no easy way to understand whether the application is Dockerized or not.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Moreover, when querying the host name (for example, in Java: InetAddress.getLocalHost().</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">getHostName()) the host name is represented by an integer, which is meaningless.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">It will be very useful, especially for monitoring &amp; diagnostics purposes, to be able to easily fetch (local file injected to the container fs on startup?)</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">the container info, such as real host name, image name, container name and container ID.</sentence>
