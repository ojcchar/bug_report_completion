	<title>UX: docker network inspect should include container names</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">The `docker network inspect` output only contains container-ID's.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Given that service discovery is based on container names, it's odd that the container-names / service-names are not included in the output.</sentence>
