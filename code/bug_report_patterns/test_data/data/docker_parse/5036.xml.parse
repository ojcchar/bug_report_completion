	<title>Feature Request: Click on nav bar gives top level doc</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">It would be nice if I click on Examples or Installation that I get taken to a top level doc about that subject.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">It was something we wanted to do in the old doc format but couldn't figure out how to do properly with the style of hiding/showing we were doing.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I think you could do it with the current format though (i.e. turn Home About Reference Installation ... Docker Index each into links themselves)</sentence>
