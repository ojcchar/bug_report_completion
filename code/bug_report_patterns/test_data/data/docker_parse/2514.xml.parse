	<title>In context of --link option, reconsider the term 'child'</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Typically, when launching the linked containers, say in order A followed by B, the B container will be run with the --link option.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Even though A was launched before B, in the docs we call A a child of B, which seems backwards.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Moreover, IIUC, container A can be restarted with a --link option linking back to B, so now they are recursively children of each other.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Maybe the term 'peer' would be more appropriate when referring to containers --link'd together.</sentence>
