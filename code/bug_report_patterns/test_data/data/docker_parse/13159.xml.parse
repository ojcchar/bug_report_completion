	<title>Consider allowing the Docker data file in /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/devicemapper to exceed 100GB</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I've noticed that if we want to use external storage via the docker-storage file for Docker, we have to configure a block-based device.</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.1">However, it also seems possible to mount NFS directly to /var/lib/docker and leverage that for Docker images instead.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This provides us with more free space, as well as resiliency if our client ever crashed on us.</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">Additionally, if we're using clients with &gt; 100GB in free space, it would be nice to exceed that 100GB if we wanted.</sentence>
