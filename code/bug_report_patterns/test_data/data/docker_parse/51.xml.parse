		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The problem with directory hashing is that it'll be more difficult to list the containers (without walking the whole filesystem).</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">It's then mandatory to index the directories (using a sqlite db?)</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">to keep the ps command fast (and to limit this command to a certain number of containers by default).</sentence>
