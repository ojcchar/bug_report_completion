	<title>docker rmi could have a --deep option?</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When we pull down a select group of docker images and fire up a cluster of containers based on them, on our project we tend to refer to them by their name:tag.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">When we choose to dynamically clean up the pulled images, we have to do some bash magic to determine the Image ID of a given name:tag before calling `docker rmi`.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">But it would be really nice to be able to call `docker rmi --deep [name:tag]` and docker would remove not just the local tag, but all tag references and the image.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Currently if you are removing using name:tag, you have to delete each tag, and the last one deletes the actual image (understandable default behavior).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">This would be handy for CI/CD workflows that run integration/system tests on dynamically produced and tagged docker image clusters.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Just food for thought...</sentence>
