	<title>Move pid file operations to /pkg/ dir</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">**Summary**:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Currently there is code in `/utils/daemon.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">go` to handle pid file creation and removal.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">This package is too big and there are little testing for these functions.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">**Proposed solution**:</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Move the two functions for pid file creation and removal to a separate package in the `/pkg` directory called `pidfile`.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">It would be a clean api if we used a type that could have the removal in a `defer` by the caller.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">```go
import "github.com/docker/pkg/pidfile"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">file, err := pidfile.New(path)
if err != nil {
// handle
}
defer file.Remove()
```</sentence>
