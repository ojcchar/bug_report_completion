	<title>Single Binary for 1.11</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Docker 1.11 is now composed of 4 binaries (docker, docker-containerd, docker-containerd-shim and docker-runc).</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">For me this creates a huge headache in moving from Docker &lt;= 1.10 to 1.11 and impedes my ability to support it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">I'm creating this issue for the purpose of finding out if I'm alone in this regard or if more people feel that they will be impacted.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Hopefully this will gauge if theres any merit to creating a single binary again.</sentence>
