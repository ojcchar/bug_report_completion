			<sentence id="1.1">I was doing some troubleshooting on why docker was starting before my remote filesystems had mounted, even after applying the changes from https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/17731 to the upstart script.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I noticed that the installation had provided both a `/etc/init/docker.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">conf` as well as `/etc/init.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">d/docker` script.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">The init.d script was taking precedence and all settings in the upstart script were being ignored.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.6">Removing the init.d script fixed the issue.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.7">Is there any reason that both are provided?</sentence>
