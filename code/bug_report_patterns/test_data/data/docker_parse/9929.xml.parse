			<sentence id="3.1">yaronr: Strange. After bind-mounting a file, it changes to be a directory. removing the -v - and the file is a file again..</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">yaronr: has anyone seen this?</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">erikh: it's a known issue</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">yaronr: erikh: really ?! I've spent hours on it</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.5">yaronr:it used to work.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.6">erikh: when?</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.7">yaronr: up until a couple of weeks ago. I have this unit file that uses this approach to map a config file from the host to the container</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.8">yaronr: erikh: I actually have a few of them..</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.9">erikh: what version of docker were you using before?</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.13">yaronr: yup</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.24">erikh: don't swear so quickly ;)</sentence>
