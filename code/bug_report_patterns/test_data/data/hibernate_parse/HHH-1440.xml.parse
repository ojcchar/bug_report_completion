	<title>Order-by mapping with table per subclass issue</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I have 2 classes:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Class Foo
{
 int id;
 int age;
}</sentence>

		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Class Bar extends Foo
{
 int type;
}</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Bar is mapped using tabel per subclass so we end with 2 tables
table foo(int id,int age)
table bar (foo int,type int)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">So far so good, then i have another class which hold a set of Bar and i would like to map this set with an explicit sql ordering with order-by attribute:
order-by="age"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Hib will produce an error because the table bar does not have any age attribute.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">While i understand that the order-by works with SQL directly, i think hibernate could easily make this work.</sentence>
