	<title>Problem generating HQL alias for Oracle's ROWID</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">If you map Oracle's ROWID as if it were a column (in my case, the PK for legacy data) the SQL that is generated by using Criteria works just fine, but the SQL that is generated by HQL cannot be executed.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Criteria SQL:
select this_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">ROWID as ROWID0_, ....</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">HQL SQL:
select test0_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">ROWID as ROWID, ....</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">The reason the HQL SQL does not work is that ROWID is a keyword in Oracle and cannot be used as the alias.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">I have narrowed down the problem to org.hibernate.mapping.Column.getAlias().</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">When it receives the column "ROWID", it returns "ROWID" as the alias.</sentence>
