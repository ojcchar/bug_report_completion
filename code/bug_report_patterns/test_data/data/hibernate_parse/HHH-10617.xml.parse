		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When loading multiple entities via:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">{code}
List&lt;SomeClass&gt; list = session.byMultipleIds(SomeClass.class).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">multiLoad(ids);
{code}</sentence>

		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">the resulting list may have unexpected properties:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1"># If the fetch for {{SomeClass}} contains left outer joins, some instances may be contained multiple times in the resulting list.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2"># Both {{ids}} and the returned {{List&lt;&gt;}} are _ordered_ collections.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">The principle of least surprise dictates, that both collections have the _same_ order.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">In pseudo-code: {{list.get(j).</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.5">getId().</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.6">equals(ids.get(j))}} should be {{true}} for any {{j}}.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.7">Unless of course a different behavior is documented (it's not, as far as I can tell)
# If an entity for a given id cannot be found, I expect a {{null}} in the returned list at the index of that id.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.8">That's not the case.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">It would be nice, if either these failures got fixed or the documentation got adjusted to reflect the behavior.</sentence>
