	<title>"native" ID generator is broken when using Oracle12cDialect</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">This is reproduced by running org.hibernate.test.hql.BulkManipulationTest.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">All tests that execute {{TestData#prepare}} fail when inserting an entity with a "native" ID generator mapped.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Using Oracle12cDialect, the "native" generator is an identity; in superclass Oracle dialects, the "native" generator is a sequence.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Tests pass if "native" is changed to "sequence".</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Tests also pass using Oracle10gDialect with an Oracle 12c DB (but ID generator is sequence).</sentence>
