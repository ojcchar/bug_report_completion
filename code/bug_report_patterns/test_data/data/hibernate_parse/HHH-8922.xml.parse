	<title>ClassLoaderServiceImpl introduces random classpath ordering via HashSet</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">In previous versions of hibernate upto and including 4.2.8 the classpath order was respected when loading persistence.xml.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">The implementation was in {{org.hibernate.service.classloading.internal.ClassLoaderServiceImpl.getResources(String)}} which was implemented using an {{ArrayList}}</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">But since 4.3.0 the functionality appears to have been moved to:
{{org.hibernate.boot.registry.classloading.internal.ClassLoaderServiceImpl.getResources(String)}} using a {{HashSet}} introducing an undesirable random element into the ordering.</sentence>
