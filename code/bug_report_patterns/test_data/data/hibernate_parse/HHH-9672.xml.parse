	<title>BasicPropertyAccessor: Fails randomly to find the getter of a property</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">{{org.hibernate.property.BasicPropertyAccessor.getterMethod(Class, String)}} tries to find the getter for a given bean property.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">This might fail, if there are a getter and an 'isser' for that property:
{code}
public class Entity {
 @ManyToOne
 SomeType getValue() {}</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">@Transient
 boolean isValue() {}
}
{code}
Such code might exists for convenience, e.g. to check if a property is not null or initialized or whatever.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">The outcome of {{org.hibernate.property.BasicPropertyAccessor.getterMethod(Class, String)}} depends on the order of the result of {{Class.getDeclaredMethods}}, which depends on the current environment, heavily.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Attached you'll find a Testcase that tries to reproduce that behavior.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">Unfortunately it's impossible to reproduce this issue on all executions of this test case, because of the randomndess nature of this issue.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Please see HHH-3724 for a suggested solution.</sentence>
