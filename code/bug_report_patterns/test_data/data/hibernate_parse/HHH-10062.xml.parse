	<title>ScrollableResults with join fetch reuses proxy rather than loading actual object.</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">The attached test case project shows a situation where using ScrollableResults does not hydrate a proxy object upon join fetch where-as using the JPA getResultList method does.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Start test-case application using maven:</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">mvn tomcat7:run</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3"># http://localhost:8080/proxy-fetch-test-case/good</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">Association loaded successfully using getResultList()</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5"># http://localhost:8080/proxy-fetch-test-case/bad</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">Association not loaded with lazily loaded exception using ScrollableResults</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The expectation was that objects would be loaded identically regardless of using scrollable results or using get result list from JPA.</sentence>
