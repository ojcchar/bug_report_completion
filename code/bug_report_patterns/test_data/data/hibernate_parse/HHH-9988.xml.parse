	<title>Separate transaction manager used for Hibernate and caches</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">In current code, using transactional/non-transactional caches is often mixed with using JTA/nonJTA transactions.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">However, these are separate things: JTA/non-JTA relates to general isolation, while transactional/non-transactional caches is rather an implementation detail.</sentence>
