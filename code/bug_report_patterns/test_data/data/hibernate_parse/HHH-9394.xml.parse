	<title>Still seeing inner join problem in 4.3.6</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Given this HQL:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">"select p, p.department from Person p left outer join p.department"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">I would expect to get results for Person's who have a null department ID.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">But instead the generated SQL is adding an inner join clause, filtering out those Persons without a department.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">select 
 person0_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">ID as ID1_1_0_, 
 department2_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.3">ID as ID1_0_1_, 
 person0_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.4">NAME as NAME2_1_0_, 
 person0_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.5">DEPARTMENT_ID as DEPARTME3_1_0_, 
 department2_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.6">NAME as NAME2_0_1_ 
from 
 PERSON person0_ 
 left outer join DEPT department1_ on person0_.</sentence>

			<sentence id="5.8">ID 
 inner join DEPT department2_ on person0_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.9">DEPARTMENT_ID=department2_.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.10">ID</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">That second inner join seems incorrect.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">This seems to be similar, if not the same as HHH-9284 and HHH-8980 which were closed as fixed in 4.3.6.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.2">But the above scenario occurs in 4.3.6.</sentence>
