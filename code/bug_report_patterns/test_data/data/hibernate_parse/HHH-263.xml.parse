	<title>Many-to-one using foreign key from joined table fails</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">We're implementing the "table per subclass using a discriminator" inheritance strategy with a legacy data model.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">In one case, a subclass table has a foreign key to another table.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">The many-to-one relationship mapped to the subclass table works fine, but the inverse one-to-many relationship expects the foreign key to be on the base table rather than the subclass table.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">As a result, the collection representing the one-to-many relationship generates bad SQL and fails to load.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I will attach a small test case which is a bit contrived but illustrates the problem.</sentence>
