			<sentence id="2.1">Apache web server uses ISO-8859-1 as default charset for sending all the responses, whereas as I want to use UTF-8 or shift_JIS as charset.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I tried adding the parameter "AddDefaultCharset UTF-8" in httpd.conf file as well as .</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">htaccess file (After modifying Allowoverride to value All), but still when I am accessing a page apache uses "ISO-8859-1" in response charset.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">I am using the resources which are using "shift_JIS" encodings in the &lt;meta&gt; tags and apache is overriding the same with ISO-8859, that is why in the final page I am seeing junk characters and I have to change the encoding setting manually in the client browser to see proper text.</sentence>
