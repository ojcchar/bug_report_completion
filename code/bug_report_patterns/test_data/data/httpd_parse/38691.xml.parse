	<title>Virtual host naming problem</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When the virtual host name contains the character "_" (underscore), the cookie
function of all applications failed to work.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">The problem was discovered while using PHP 4.3.9 to initialize a new session,
where refreshing the same page keeps on generating a new session instead of
being in the current session.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The headers had Set-Cookie throughout in the HTTP-Reponse, but no Cookie in any
HTTP-Request, which is supposed to be there for a normal session operation.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">We traced into httpd.conf, php.ini, file system setting, file permission,
running services, etc., and in the end we discovered that it was the virtual
host naming that was causing the problem.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">On the same server, same setup, sessions and cookies run fine on a virtual
server without the "_" in its name.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">(i.e. proj_doc.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.3">somewhere.com would fail, but
projdoc.somewhere.com would work).</sentence>
