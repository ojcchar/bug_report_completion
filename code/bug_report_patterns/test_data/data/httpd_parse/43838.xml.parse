	<title>If-Modified-Since request and htcacheclean conflict</title>

  Apache2.2.3 setup as a reverse proxy, in a test environment ready to replace 
a production box.</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.1">Problem:
  Excessive 'If-Modified-Since' traffic to upstream server.</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">Cause:
   Every night htcacheclean is run.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">A returning Client requests an object/file using 'If-Modifed-Since' in the 
header, as the client has locally cached copy.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Symptom:
   Reverse proxy makes 'If-Modifed-Since' request to upstream server as object 
is not available in cache.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">Upstream server will reply with '304 Not-Modifed'.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">Note, Proxy still doesn't have a copy.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">The expected action would be for the proxy to get the object, and 
report '304 Not-Modifed' to the client, so that the next request is served out 
of cache, and no further traffic occurs between proxy and upstream server.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Observation:
  If the clients cache is cleared, the next request comes from the upstream 
server, then subsequent requests come from the proxy's cache.</sentence>

In mod-proxy-http.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.2">c we have removed the test 'if r-&gt;main' check (snippet 
below), which appears to remove the "If-*" headers to the upstream server, but 
this may have other side effects, but gives us the desired operation.</sentence>
