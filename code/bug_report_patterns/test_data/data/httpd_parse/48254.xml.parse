	<title>Bogus "DocumentRoot does not exist" warning when set to a file</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I often set the DocumentRoot of a vhost to a file (PHP script) to remap requests for all URIs to a single point of entry.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">This works just fine and has never given me a problem, but Apache throws a warning about the DocumentRoot not existing.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">The existence check should probably just check for existence, and not that the DocumentRoot is a directory (which is what it is apparently doing now) or at least give a more accurate warning ("DocumentRoot is not a directory") or something.</sentence>
