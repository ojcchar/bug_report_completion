		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">http://localhost/~alex/testsite/blahblahblah</sentence>

		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">I have a .htaccess file in /home/alex/public_html/testsite that reads:</sentence>

RewriteRule ^(.</sentence>

rewrites.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">As you will see below, RewriteRule can be used in per-directory config
files (.</sentence>

			<sentence id="6.4">There it will act locally, i.e., the local directory prefix
is stripped at this stage of processing and your rewriting rules act only on the
remainder.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">If I leave the RewriteBase uncommented, I get this: "The requested URL
/home/alex/public_html/testsite/url-handler.</sentence>

works flawlessly with addresses without the ~ as far as I can tell.</sentence>
