	<title>HTTP_REFERER doesn't always work</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I have notices that apache2 doesn't generate http_referer for logs and scripts
if I'm using Mozilla, IE or Lynx.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">If I telnet to http-port and manually enter
the refererer, it works OK.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I have checked with Ethereal that Moz and IE use the referer and it is correct
and sent to server, but Apache just ignores it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Maybe those other fields that
browsers  send confuse Apache?</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">The referer isn't shown in logs (empty referer
there) or in any php script I try.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">Other environment variables (that I've tried)
work just fine.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">I'm using Apache 2.0.4 and PHP 4.3.0</sentence>
