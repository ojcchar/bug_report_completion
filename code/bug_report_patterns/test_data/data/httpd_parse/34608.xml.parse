			<sentence id="6.1">However, it kind of defeats the purpose of mod_vhost_alias if the Directory
directive won't interprete %O. I'm imagining it has something to do with
Directory configurations at startup vs at request time.</sentence>

documentation on what is allowed here.</sentence>

chasing it.</sentence>

tried to prove this yet.</sentence>
