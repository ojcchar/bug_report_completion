	<title>mod_proxy encodes ~ to %7E in Reverse Proxy mode</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">In a reverse proxy setup I encountered a problem with user directories; it
seemed like every now and then users got redirected to http://host/%7Euser
instead of the correct http://host/~user.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">After some debugging I figured out
that the frontend mod_proxy was "canonicalizing" URLs, thereby encoding ~ as
%7E.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">This would not be an issue but for lots of backend server software that
relied on the URL passed to the backend server to be the same as the one the
user saw in their browsers.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Now, this is of course a bad assumption *but* I
don't really know why the canonicalization happens in the first place, or even
why ~ is not considered a safe character.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I have attached a patch that simply adds '~' to the set of "reserved" characters
for modules/proxy/proxy_util.c:ap_proxy_canonenc.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">It does the job on my site.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Is
there any reason not to apply it?</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">Note: I tried to subscribe to apache-users@ to ask around for other people
experiencing this bug bug the list never confirmed my emails...</sentence>
