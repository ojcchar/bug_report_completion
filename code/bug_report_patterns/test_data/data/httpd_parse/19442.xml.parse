		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Looks like a couple of possible RFC 2616 MUST violations.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">The proxy forwards 101 (Switching Protocols) or 199 
(Extension) 1xx response but then terminates the connection
with the client instead of forwarding the "true/actual"
200 (OK) response that follows a 1xx response.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">The 100 (Continue) response is not forwarded at
all, which avoids the connection termination problem
mentioned above, but is also a MUST violation because
all unsolicited 1xx responses must be forwarded.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">See attached trace(s) for details and ways to reproduce
the violation mentioned above.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Test case IDs in the trace link to human-oriented test case
description and RFC quotes, if available.</sentence>
