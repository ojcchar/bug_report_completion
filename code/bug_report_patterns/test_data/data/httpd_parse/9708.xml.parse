	<title>POST with keep-alive increases process size</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When sending many large (1MB+) POST requests over a keep-alive connection, the
http process grows in size after each request.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">For example, after 1000 such
requests, the process size may grow by 4MB.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Without keep-alive, the processes do
not grow.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">This occurs with CGI scripts and custom C modules in Apache 2.0.36.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">However, the memory is apparently not leaked -- running the same 1000 requests
again does not cause the size to grow.</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.1">The following CGI script (post.cgi) can be used to accept the POST data:</sentence>
