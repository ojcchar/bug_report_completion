	<title>ap_cache_liststr fails to parse quoted strings</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Several coadvisor tests fail due to quoted strings being mis-parsed as cache-control directives in ap_cache_liststr.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">These MUST be ignored (rfc2616#14.9.6).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Replacing ap_cache_liststr with ap_find_list_item almost fixes it, but can't return a token's value as required by mod_cache.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Some rationalisation of this nearly-duplicated functionality would probably be a good idea.</sentence>
