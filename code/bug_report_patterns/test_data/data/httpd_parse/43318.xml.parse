		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">A broken CherryPy backend (returning "HTTP/1.1 Date: blahblah" as the first
line) revealed a bug in the mod_proxy_http code.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">If the HTTP response line is
malformed, mod_proxy_http acts as if ProxyBadHeader was set to StartBody, i.e.
it returns the entire backend response as the body of the proxy's response.</sentence>
