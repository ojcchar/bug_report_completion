	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">If a automated tool is used to scan a website it can start to crawl upwards in 
file structure.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">This happens if the start-URL points to a location without an index.html
If mod_autoindex generates a index.html, it will contain a link to a directory 
level one level up i.e. Parent Directory.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">An automated tool such as HTTrack (http://www.httrack.com/) will treat Parent 
Directory as any link and climb one level up and scan that level.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">This is not 
always good.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">HTTrack may work it self up to top level if only mod_autoindex generates the 
contents of each directory.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Suggestion: Add IndexOptions Directive "SuppressParentDirectory" to prevent 
mod_autoindex to show a link to the parent directory.</sentence>
