	<title>data loss with httpd-2.0.55 reverse proxy method=post</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">2 PCs with httpd-2.0.55 running and https enabled (OS SLES9).</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">The first one is
the "real" webserver with all the documents (HTML-pages, etc), the other
webserver is configured as a reverse proxy which gets all the data from the
"real" webserver.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">With a browser I can access both webservers and everything seems to be OK.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The problem: 
When I get a form (method="post") through the reverse proxy and send it back,
some of the "post"ed data dont reach the "real" webserver.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">It seems to happen always if the total amount of posted data is larger than 8
kbytes.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">When I get a form from the "real" webserver directly and send it back there is
no loss of data (at any amount).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">The "real" webserver and the reverse proxy are talking via https to each other.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">Switching to http does not solve the problem.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">When _both_ webservers are switched to http the problem has disappeared, but
this is not really a solution for me.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">Downgrading the reverse proxy to httpd-2.0.54 (both webservers with https,
"real" webserver stays with httpd-2.0.55) solved the problem.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="8">
			<sentence id="8.1">During all tries I left the httpd.conf and ssl.conf unchanged (exception:
ProxyPass and ProxyPassReverse for http/https switching of course)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="9">
			<sentence id="9.1">Reverse proxy configuration:
&lt;IfModule mod_proxy.</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.2">c&gt;
    SSLProxyEngine       on
    ProxyRequests        off
    ProxyPass            /  https://10.34.56.78/
    ProxyPassReverse     /  https://10.34.56.78/
&lt;/IFModule&gt;</sentence>
