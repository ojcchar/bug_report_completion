			<sentence id="2.3">page)$ ajp://hostname:8009$1
then I get the following error :
Syntax error on line 573 of C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/conf/httpd.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">conf:
ProxyPass Unable to parse URL</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">I noticed that it is the concatenation of hostname + port + $1 that causes trouble.</sentence>
