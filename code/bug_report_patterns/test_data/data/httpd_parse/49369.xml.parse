	<title>mod_deflate output filters pass empty brigades down the filter chain</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">If mod_deflate's output filters are passed an empty brigade, they will pass the empty brigade to the next filter in the chain.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">This is contrary to what is recommended by the "Guide to writing output filters" on the httpd website &lt;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/developer/output-filters.html&gt;.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">According to that page, empty brigades should be suppressed; upon seeing an empty brigade, the filter should simply return APR_SUCCESS rather than calling ap_pass_brigade.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">This would be a trivial (2-line) change to mod_deflate.</sentence>
