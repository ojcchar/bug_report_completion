	<title>Weird DirectoryIndex/XBitHack problem</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Hi, I'm having problems regularly reproducing this, so please bear with me.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Ok, the first reason I noticed this problem in the first place was that 
whenever I reloaded the root page off of my site, about 2/3 of the time it 
would produce a 416 error.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Reloading always gives the normal page back, but 
reloading again gives the 416 error back most of the time.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Turning off 
XBitHack in my config made this behavior go away.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Ok, here's where it started to get bizarre.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I was going to submit this report 
earlier today, but in testing it with netscape on a Solaris box, it wouldn't 
show itself.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Then I tried with IE for Solaris, and it "occasionally" showed 
itself.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">Then... Then I removed the user x bit from index.html, and the 
problem went away.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">Then I turned XBitHack back on, and the x bit on 
index.html, and everything was -still- behaving correctly.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">(?)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Here's more of the weirdness.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">The whole time, if I go to index.html directly, 
ie:
http://www.vorpalcloud.org:81/index.html
instead of
http://www.vorpalcloud.org:81/
it would also work fine, XBitHack or not.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">(Note that port 80 is my 
current 'production' apache 1.3.X server)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Anyway, I still can't get the 416 error to resurface itself.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">However, the 
server side includes on the index.html page are not working if you don't go 
directly to index.html.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">I'm not sure why it's not working with a 
DirectoryIndex style access to index.html, but it isn't.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">So...  on a related 
note (why I'm including it with this bug report)....</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">When I go to http://www.vorpalcloud.org:81/gallery/ from IE under windows, it 
gives me the index.php script as is (doesn't actually run it), but if I go 
directly to it, it works just fine.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">Likewise, from other browsers, it works 
just fine without going directly to index.php.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">I don't know, something weird seems to be happening with DirectoryIndex style 
accesses.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">It's like it's handing me the pages just fine, but if it's not 
bothering to procss them at all.</sentence>
