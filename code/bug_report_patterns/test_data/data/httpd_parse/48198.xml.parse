			<sentence id="1.1">Patch of rc.subr
http://server.in/softdev/fib_patch.html</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">in 2.2.11 you write:</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">[ -z "$apache22_fib" ] &amp;&amp; apache22_fib="NO"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">instead of old one:</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">[ -z "$apache22_fib" ] &amp;&amp; apache22_fib="0"</sentence>

		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Let's guess what is better OLD or NEW form?</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">I think OLD form is better, becase of apache_fib="NO" really means to use FIB by default.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.3">That is fib with '0'.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">So in your script you must chech if apache_fib eq '0' or 'NO' 
then return 0 
else 
command="setfib -F ${apache22_fib} ${command}"</sentence>
