			<sentence id="5.1">To expound/recap/emphasize, the bug appears in #3, where Apache returns 301 -
"Moved Permanently" after a lowercase command was sent, instead of returning
501, which it should to be standards conformant.</sentence>

'thisdirdoesntexist' is a directory on the server that, well, doesn't exist.</sentence>
