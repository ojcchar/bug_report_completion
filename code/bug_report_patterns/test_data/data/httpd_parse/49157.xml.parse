		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">It seems that the xml output of the balancer manager is not working as the html version and has some other issues</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">1 http://server/balancer-manager?xml=1 gives the html output if parameter nonce is not provided</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">2 http://server/balancer-manager?xml=1&amp;nonce=.... gives an xml output, but only scheme, hostname and load factor values of a worker.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">The other fields of the html version (load factor, status etc.) are not provided.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">In addition hostname only shows the ip address and not ip:port if a port is configured</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">3 Putting a &lt;nonce&gt; node in the xml would be nice</sentence>
