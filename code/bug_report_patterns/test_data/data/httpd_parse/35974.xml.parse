	<title>Occasional seg fault/bus error in NFS hosted includes-parsed files</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">We're running Apache 2.0.54 on multiple Solaris 8 machines, using the prefork
MPM, mmap and sendfile turned off - sharing a NFS mounted docroot hosted by a
NetApp.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Occasionally we are getting child processes die with either a bus error
or segmentation fault - it seems to be taking the order of 1-2 hours of
high-load production traffic to happen.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">From the cores I've inspected, they all
seem to be when a request is being parsed by mod_include (so I've marked that as
the component - though something else may be at fault).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Having searched around, bug 34708 and bug 19325 look as if they might be related</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">to this. Certainly the files in our docroot do get modified. The process would</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">be for the file to be removed, and then recreated by another system. So Apache</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">might be getting upset by the file disappearing mid request. It's unlikely</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">(though I guess possible) that a file would be removed and recreated in time for</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">Apache to have one request on the original file and the subsequent request on</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.7">the new file (ie: without accessing it in the period of "no file"). My attempts</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.8">at trying to recreate this scenario without production traffic have failed. So</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.9">it's been difficult to rule out particular system components (though we have</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.10">unloaded as much of our code as possible). Additionally, we are seeing some</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.11">errors on a couple of servers that have a different docroot (though still on</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.12">NFS) where files seldom change (or at least not at the times we've seen errors).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Based on comments in one of the bugs above, and looking at the head revision of
apr-util-trunk, I've also patched apr_buckets_file.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">c (two liner - so it checks
for APR_EOF) - I'll attach the diff.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">We still get errors (though it doesn't
appear to hurt so I've left it in for now)...</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">I've got two backtraces which I'll attach.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">Unfortunately we weren't initially
compiling with debugging symbols, though we have now enabled that.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">Since
enabling, we've only had one error - otherwise I'd attach more.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">I'd offer to upload the core file but it's 100Mb as we have a huge chunk of
shared memory in use.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">Note that I don't think that is to blame because the other
servers don't use it (waiting for a segfault there so I can upload that
instead), and because the points of failure don't implicate it at all.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Any questions or things you'd like me to try - please ask.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">Really keen to get to
the bottom of this.</sentence>
