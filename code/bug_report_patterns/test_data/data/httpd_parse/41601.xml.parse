	<title>proxied redirects lose output headers</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Problem: With Apache configured as a reverse HTTP proxy, when the backend server
returns a redirect, any output headers (other than Location) are getting lost.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I
noticed and reproduced this with Set-Cookie but it applies to others too.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Cause: What's happening is that proxy_http_handler() in
modules/proxy/mod_proxy_http.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">c is returning an error state (ie: not OK or DONE)
to ap_process_request() in modules/http/http_request.c ap_invoke_handler (by way
of ap_invoke_handler/ap_run_handler).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">This causes ap_die() to be invoked, and
there the output headers are replaced with the error headers.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">The Location is
specifically kept.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">The body is also potentially stripped (though for most
redirects this is not an issue).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The bug seems to be that ap_proxy_http_process_response() - called within
proxy_http_handler() - is being too restrictive in what HTTP status code it
considers to be "not an error" when dealing with its error-override logic:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">if (conf-&gt;error_override) {</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">/* the code above this checks for 'OK' which is what the hook expects */</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">if (ap_is_HTTP_SUCCESS(r-&gt;status))</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">return OK;</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.5">else {</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.6">// ... stripped some lines here for clarity</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.7">return r-&gt;status;</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.8">}</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.9">} else</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.10">return OK;</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">So if you have 'ProxyErrorOverride On', this will return OK if the status coming
from the backend server is &gt;= 200 or &lt; 300 only.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">Obviously redirects (which are
not errors) fall outside of this range.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Fix: the check here needs to also include redirect status codes.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">Ie: use
ap_is_HTTP_REDIRECT.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.3">There is a similar check futher up in the same function
which also needs ammending (that deals with passing the body through).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">This bug is a regression in behaviour from the 2.0 branch (currently we run</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.2">2 0.58).</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.3">Bug discovered and fix tested with 2.2.4 (will attach patch).</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.4">Looking</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.5">at SVN, the current behaviour has been in the 2.2 branch since before 2.2.0, and</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.6">it is also in current trunk.</sentence>
