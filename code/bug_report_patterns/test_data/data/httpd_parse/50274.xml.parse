	<title>always pass CONTENT_LENGTH to the application</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">FastCGI spec indicates that CONTENT_LENGTH will be provided to the
app, even though the request body will be sent to the application in
chunks.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Furthermore, it suggests that the app could compare
CONTENT_LENGTH with the actual length received to determine if the
client aborted before sending the entire body.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">mod_fastcgi: as with mod_cgi/mod_cgid: the request fails with 411 if
the client doesn't send content-length</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">mod_fcgid: request is fine if client doesn't send content-length, but
application doesn't get CONTENT_LENGTH (bug)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">mod_fcgid spools the entire body to memory/disk before connecting to
the app, so it should go ahead and pass over a computed CONTENT_LENGTH
value; that would also resolve a Content-Length value from the client
which becomes invalid because of a filter.</sentence>
