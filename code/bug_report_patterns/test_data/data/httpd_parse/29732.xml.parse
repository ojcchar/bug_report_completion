	<title>Define which type regular expressions used in Apache</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">The document "Terms Used to Describe Directives" gives a generic description of
what a "regex" is, but not what syntax is expected.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">It should say that the PCRE
library is used, and a link to documentation of it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Eg.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">http://www.pcre.org/pcre.txt or to Perl documentation (which might be better).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Additionally, it might not hurt to have a See Also link to something like
"Regular Expressions in Apache" for applicable directives, because I fear that
few people would think of looking in the "right" place.</sentence>
