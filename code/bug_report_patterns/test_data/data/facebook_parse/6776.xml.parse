			<sentence id="2.1">We host the Fan Box widget in an iframe and use the facebook connect method to render it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">We recently noticed that users who are not verified are prompted with the security check when they click the button.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">The security check is much larger than the iframe and their are no scroll bars so the user can not see the word challenge and act upon it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">See attached.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">It would be ideal to either remove the security challenge all together or develop a better way to render it so it won t break the pages.</sentence>
