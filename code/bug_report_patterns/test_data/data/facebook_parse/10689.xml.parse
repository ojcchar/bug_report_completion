	<title>Proxy does not load images on slower servers for application tabs</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Hello_</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">       For over a week now I have had no luck getting any images to load on my application tab on a test fan page:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">http://www.facebook.com/pages/TestBally/115010348533485?v=app_113207468718825</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">       The application the tab loads from works fine on facebook s server:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">http://apps.facebook.com/ballypolls/tab.php</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.6">       And the tab that page loads from works fine on my server as well:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.7">http://problemstosolve.com/ballypoll/tab.php</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.8">       I believe this is some freak issue with the image proxy_ because it is not happening with other application tabs I ve built.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.9">When I just reduce the page down to a simple image SRC_ even that doesn t load.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.10">For instance_ I have tried this as my only line of FBML:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.11">&lt;img src= http://bally_facebook.manifestdigital.net/images/poll_submit.png &gt;</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.12">       This image gets replaced by the proxy to:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.13">http://platform.ak.fbcdn.net/www/app_full_proxy.php?app=113207468718825&amp;v=1&amp;size=o&amp;cksum=18696df5095bf91bc72652d733fa6d25&amp;src=http%3A%2F%2Fbally_facebook.manifestdigital.net%2Fimages%2Fpoll_submit.png</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.14">       which does not load. I tried duplicating the image_ as:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.15">http://bally_facebook.manifestdigital.net/images/poll_submitd.png</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.16">       but even that does not load via the proxy.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.17">       Please help! This has delayed this project for over a week.</sentence>
