		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Since yesterday (Tuesday_ 12/29)_ we ve seen a sudden increase in  unknown error occurred  errors across our user base when fetching news feed posts.</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.1">After some experimentation_ it seems that facebook seems to run out of resources handling the number of posts being requested.</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">For example_ for a specific user:
https://graph.facebook.com/me/home?limit=36&amp;access_token=[token]</sentence>

		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">will work_ but:
https://graph.facebook.com/me/home?limit=37&amp;access_token=[token]</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">

			<sentence id="6.1">The weird thing is_ this problem is completely reproducible for the specific users who run into this problem_ whereas for other users we can fetch 200 items without a problem.</sentence>
