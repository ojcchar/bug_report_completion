			<sentence id="1.2">Safari was asking for  application/xhtml+xml  which is technically correct_ but Facebook s Java libs can t deal with that.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">For example_ Facebook s DOM parsing routines cannot find  head  when content type is set properly to XHTML_ because they are looking for upper-case  HEAD  as would be expected in an HTML document.</sentence>
