			<sentence id="2.1">Overview</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Users are intermittently seeing reduced browser performance_ causing several different apps to run slowly and in some cases for the browser to crash.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">This happens in about 10% of play sessions.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">It can occur on page load_ or sometimes on launching the invite dialog (an XFBML overlay).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">When the performance hit is observed we notice that there are repeated continuous requests to our cross-domain receiver file (as passed into FB.init()).</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">This normally continues indefinitely until the page reloads or browser crashes.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">It has been also observed to self-correct on at least one occasion.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">See attached Firebug console screenshot showing multiple calls.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Steps to Reproduce</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Observed in Firefox 3 and Chrome.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">Logs suggest the problem does not affect IE.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">- Loading the canvas page (apps.facebook.com/petsociety_ apps.facebook.com/maddennflsuperstars) can trigger the continuous loop.</sentence>
			<sentence id="7.2">= - = - - Displaying FBML dialogs is another intermittent trigger (e.g. click the  invite friends  button above the game).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="8">
			<sentence id="8.1">Environment</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="9">
			<sentence id="9.1">App running in FBML mode_ hosting an fb:iframe with the bulk of the game contents.</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.2">JS SDK v0.4 (the  old  SDK).</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.3">Canvas page contains several FBML elements used to display UI as iframe overlays.</sentence>

			<sentence id="11.1">Possible Causes (Speculative)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="12">
			<sentence id="12.1">We ve made some observations that go some way to explaining what might be happening_ though the precise trigger is still unknown.</sentence>
			<sentence id="12.2">There seems to be a feedback loop causing cross-domain requests to be issued faster than they can be resolved.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="13">
			<sentence id="13.1">We notice that the calls to the XD receiver file are made from within the FB JS SDK by appending an &lt;iframe src= ourXDReceiverURL &gt; to the document.</sentence>
			<sentence id="13.2">These are sometimes visible and always show up in the DOM.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="14">
			<sentence id="14.1">We think each iframe added is increasing the size of the canvas page_ resulting in a call to XFBML.setSizeToContent().</sentence>
			<sentence id="14.2">This triggers its own cross-domain request_ adds another iframe_ and the cycle continues.</sentence>
			<sentence id="14.3">This is also suggested by the logging output and looking at the XD request query parameters_ which reflect an ever increasing canvas height.</sentence>

			<sentence id="16.1">Could our problem be something as simple as having a missing CSS style (FB_RECEIVER_DOM) that would normally be applied to the iframe?</sentence>
