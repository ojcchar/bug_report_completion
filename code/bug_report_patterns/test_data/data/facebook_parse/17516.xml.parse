	<title>Requests 2.0: filters parameter disappeared</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">What has happened to the  filters  parameter of Requests 2.0?</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Essentially the documentation of FB.ui in http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/dialogs/requests/ used to say that you can use  filters  parameter to filter the list of friends.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">That parameter is no longer in the page and I cannot find any reference to that parameter in the platform documentation.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">We have an application live with Lots of users and we re actively using this parameter.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">So_ the parameter definitely exists in Facebook production.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">My question is what should we do - keep on using the parameter?</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">Stop using it?</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">What about other projects?</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">Is it safe to use such a undocumented parameter?</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.7">We re about to launch another application that actively uses this parameter.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">IMHO the FB.ui is badly cripled without this parameters.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">So_ I don t understand why it has been taken away from the documentation.</sentence>
