		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Many times when I close a web browser window_ while on random facebook.com pages_ multiple IE windows open up.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I m not talking a couple_ but 15-20+ IE windows just keep popping up.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">It ONLY happens when I close a web browser window_ while on random facebook.com pages.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I do NOT have adware/spyware/malware and/or viruses_ so that can be removed from your diagnosis.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">It definitely has to do with the construction of your site in some fashion_ because this happens to me at no other time.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">ONLY when I m on facebook.com.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">It eats up all of my system memory (RAM) during the process_ too.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">I m not sure if it would ever stop_ but I open Windows Task Manager and  End Task  on as many of the IE instances as I can_ until it finally does stop...  ALL of the IE windows finally close “by themselves” and I usually have to send a few Windows error reports to Microsoft (probably because of the  End Task  process I go through).</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">It s a painful process to endure every time it happens.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">It seems like if I close an IE window when the facebook.com page I m on_ isn t finished  thinking  about something_ that s when it happens most often.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Anyway_ I d appreciate it if you would look into this and hopefully find a remedy soon_ because it is REALLY annoying.</sentence>
