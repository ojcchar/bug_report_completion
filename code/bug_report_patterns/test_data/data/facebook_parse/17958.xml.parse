	<title>Duplicate wall posts when posts from an app are grouped together</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Hi_
We are using the Javascript feed dialog to post to a user s news feed.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">If a user of our app chooses to post multiple things to their news feed only one post is shown and the other posts are grouped together with a  See more posts from   link which is fine.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Unfortunately the one post that is shown is duplicated when the user expands the  See more  link and this looks unprofessional.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">This only happens in news feed and not if the user goes tot heir own profile wall.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">Thanks
Dan</sentence>
