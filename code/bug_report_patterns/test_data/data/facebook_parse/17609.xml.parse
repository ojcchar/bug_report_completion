		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">We render an inviter using fb:serverFbml.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">When the content length of the script tag is below some threshold_ the xFBML code uses a GET request.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">This works fine.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">When the content length is beyond some threshold_ the xFBML code uses a POST request.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">If the user has secure browsing enabled for Facebook_ the POST is redirected to an https GET request and the parameters are lost.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.6">This returns a 404 error and the inviter never renders.</sentence>
