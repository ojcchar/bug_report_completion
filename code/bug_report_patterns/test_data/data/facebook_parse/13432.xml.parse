Devs also seeing issues when the importer tries to access a user’s email - the popup sends an ajax call to FB and the response is being blocked by the browser.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.2">At first_ it appears the process is just hanging_ but after putting the ajax URL into the browser directly it appears to be a browser security issue.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.3">When entering it directly_ a firefox popup appears saying it is an untrusted site.</sentence>
			<sentence id="6.4">Once adding to the browser’s exceptions list_ the ajax calls from the scraper works properly.</sentence>
