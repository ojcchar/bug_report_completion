	<title>fb:profile-pic XFBML creates non-secure urls in https</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">If a user is browsing in secure mode and they hit an app that uses XFBML_ the image is referenced via http instead of https.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">A work-around is to place the fb:profile-pic XFBML within a serverfbml block.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This is obviously not ideal and is prone to iframe issues_ (there s a min-height on the serverfbml iframe.)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">My final workaround is to just use the graph API and refer to https when we notice the user broswing in secure mode.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">This is also not ideal since FB redirects from https://graph.facebook.com/user_id/picture to their FBCDN address_ slowing down the render time for the image.</sentence>
