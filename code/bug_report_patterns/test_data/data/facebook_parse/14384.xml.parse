		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When using the Android SDK web login on small screens (240x320)_ one can with difficulty get as far as the  request for permissions  screen.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">But the  accept  button is not visible_ so the user has no option but to cancel.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">This can be reproduced via the emulator_ e.g running Android 2.1_ and with a Facebook app that requests the following permissions:  user_checkins _  friends_checkins _  publish_checkins _  offline_access .</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">(Requesting fewer permissions may leave room for an accept button_ although I haven t tried).</sentence>
