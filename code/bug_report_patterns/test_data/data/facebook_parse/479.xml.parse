			<sentence id="2.1">I m consistently getting an  Unknown Error  when trying to upload images using your API.  I have the exact same codebase running on 2 servers.  One works_ one does not.  The one that does not is a domain 575pro.com.  I ve attached the header and content of the Request as well as the response.  Seems very very odd for it to work differently on either machine_ esp when the call is pure HTTP.  Could there be anything A) I m doing wrong on my end B) any set up with the router_ server_ or filesystem on the machine?  Otherwise_ *all* other calls to the API (pushes and pulls) seems to work fine.</sentence>
