	<title>Refactor Plans Pager Adapter</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">The current ViewPager [adapter](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/blob/develop/WordPress/src/main/java/org/wordpress/android/ui/plans/PlansActivity.java#L252) used by plans works fine, but it's not optimal.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Ideally the adapter should take care of creating and destroying fragments as needed, but our adapter is instead passed a list of fragments in its constructor.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This means in low-memory situations the adapter can't release fragments, and rotating the device causes the fragments to be recreated when they don't need to be.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">In addition, the adapter should be able to restore the previously selected page without us having to do so.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Note: wait for #3857 to be merged before submitting a PR for this.</sentence>
