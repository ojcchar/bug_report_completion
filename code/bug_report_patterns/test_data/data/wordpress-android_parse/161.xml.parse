		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Go to the themes feature and let it load.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Tap the refresh button in the action bar
The large spinner reappears over the loaded themes in the list.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">This seems especially weird as I can still scroll the list while its refreshing.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">I'd expect either that the large spinner would not appear, or that I would not be able to scroll while it was visible.</sentence>
