			<sentence id="1.1">### Expected behavior</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">When replying to a comment notification, if you leave the same comment twice, a message pops up that should say "_Duplicate comment detected; It looks as through you've already said that!</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">_"</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">### Actual behavior
The message doesn't render the apostrophe correctly, and actually reads as "_Duplicate comment detected; It looks as through you#8217;ve already said that!</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">_</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">This only happens when replying from the notification.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">Replying from the Reader displays a more basic "_Couldn't post your comment_" popup.</sentence>
