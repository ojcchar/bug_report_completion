	<title>Reader: 'New Posts' button can be a bully.</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">The 'New Posts' button that appears in the Reader is handy when you actually want to go to the top of the list.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">But often, I want to stay where I am instead of going to the top and the button doesn't go away ever so you get stuck with it.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Idea: We could hide the button again if the user scrolls the list after the button first appears?</sentence>
