	<title>My Profile: Rotating device loses unsaved changes</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">While editing the fields in the My Profile section in /me, I rotated my device.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">This closed the window where I was making the changes without saving anything, so my changes were lost.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">That wouldn't be so terrible for the first/last name or display name, but I had added a big chunk of text to the "About Me" section and it was frustrating to lose it and have to start over.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Ideally, I should be able to rotate the device and have the field I was editing stay open so I can continue editing it until I save or cancel the changes.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Tested on Nexus 9, Android 6.0.1, beta 5.0-rc-1</sentence>
