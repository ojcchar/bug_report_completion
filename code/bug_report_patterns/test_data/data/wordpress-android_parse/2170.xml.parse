	<title>Stats: Should we fall back to using URL when loading blog preview of private blogs, or HTTP protected blogs</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Some wp.com users have a primary site marked as private, so the Reader API will receive a 403 as response code (ex: https://public-api.wordpress.com/rest/v1/sites/kevinjmorrisuk.wordpress.com ) and the UI shows a simple error message "Unable to show this blog" in a Toast.</sentence>
