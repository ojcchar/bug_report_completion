	<title>Cannot log into self-hosted Wordpress installation</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I have a Wordpress (network, ie multi-site) installation at http://wp.bernhard_reiter.public2.linz.at/ which I cannot log into using the latest version of the Wordpress for Android app (on Android 4.1.2); the app asks me to "Check if the given Blog URL is valid" (in German, so my translation may be inaccurate).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I suspect that the reason might be the underscore in the URL which I believe isn't conforming to whatever RFC regulates domain names, but it's a free hosting service offered by my city and they told me they're not going to change that.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">I'm also paying for a domain http://raz.or.at which I use to cloak that ugly URL via an inverse proxy.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">On the Wordpress side of things, that means HOME is set to raz.or.at (and to 3 or 4 *subdomain*.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">raz.or.at subdomains).</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">Unfortunately, I cannot connect to that URL either, but in this case, I'm given an error that reads "We cannot log you in.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.5">Could not connect to the Wordpress website."</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Needless to say, I'd really love to use the app to connect to my WP installation.</sentence>
