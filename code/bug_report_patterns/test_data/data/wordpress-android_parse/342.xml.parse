	<title>Media: Simple image editing would be useful</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When adding an image to a post either by capturing from within the WP editor or when browsing from the photo library, you can't crop or change the orientation.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">A real life scenario:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">1 I snapped a couple of photos of things my daughter had hand-written.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">2 They're in the photo library now.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">3 I upload to a post.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">4 Oops, they're sideways.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">5 I try to rotate within the WP app with no luck.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.6">6 I go into the photo library and rotate and crop.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.7">7 Now I have a duplicate image.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.8">8 What's worse, if I left the post mid-composition to edit the photos, my changes to the post are lost unless I remembered to save a draft first.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.9">9 Now I reinsert into the post and publish.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">If there's an API for doing even just basic rotating and cropping from within the app (say from the screen you get when you double-click an image within the editor), it'd make for a much improved workflow and reduce the likelihood of data loss.</sentence>
