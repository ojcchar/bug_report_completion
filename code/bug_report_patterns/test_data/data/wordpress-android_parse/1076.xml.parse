	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">If a post doesn't have a featured image, the app first checks for a "featured_media" object, and if that doesn't exist it then searches the content looking for a suitably large image.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">There are a few bugs with this right now, though:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">1 If "featured_media" exists but is empty, the app skips searching for a large image</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">2 If app only searches WP posts for large images (so RSS posts coming from a WP blog are skipped)</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">3 When post detail shows the featured image above the post, it crops it unnecessarily</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">4 Featured image is sometimes incorrectly changed when post is updated by detail view</sentence>
