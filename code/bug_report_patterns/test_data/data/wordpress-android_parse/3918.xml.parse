	<title>My Sites: Visit Site view does not display Like button or Likes</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">### Expected behavior</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.1">In the `View Site` view from the `My Sites`, the `Like` button and the list of Likes should show up at the bottom of the posts, next to the Follow button.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I confirmed that this functions properly on iOS:</sentence>

			<sentence id="4.1">### Actual behavior</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.1">On Android, this part seems to get stuck with the `Loading ...` message and never populates button or list of Likes:</sentence>

			<sentence id="7.1">This _may_ be related to #3899, but it seems like a different issue.</sentence>

			<sentence id="8.1">### Steps to reproduce the behavior</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.1">From the `My Sites` screen (the WordPress icon in the top nav bar), select a site (if you are already placed in the site details view, go back one view via `&lt;- SWITCH SITE`).</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.2">From there, select `View Site`.</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.3">From here, when you scroll through the post listing on this front-end view of the site, you will notice that the `Like` buttons and list of Likes are not getting rendered but, instead, stuck at `Loading...`.</sentence>
			<sentence id="9.4">This seems like a pretty minor bug but I thought it was worth reporting anyway, especially since it works on iOS.</sentence>
