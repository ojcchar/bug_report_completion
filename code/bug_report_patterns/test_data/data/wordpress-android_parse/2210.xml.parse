	<title>Chart changes width when switching between different data sets</title>

		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Chart changes width when switching between different data sets, presumably because its width is dependent on the width of the y-axis label elements ... these should probably be unrelated.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Maybe better to allow for up to 1M on the y-axis as a max, always, and then let y-axis labels overflow into the chart itself?</sentence>
