			<sentence id="1.1">Including the header view in each row seems excessive, and it causes a few weird animation issues in certain scenarios (such as when trashing a comment that contains the header).</sentence>

		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Might work best to have them be their own rows, which would fix the animation stuff but make the adapter harder to maintain...</sentence>
