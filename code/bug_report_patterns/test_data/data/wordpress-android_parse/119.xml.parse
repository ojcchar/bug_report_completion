			<sentence id="1.1">I was wondering if there is any plans and/or interest in refactoring this code into 2 projects (in the same repo).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">For example the repo structure could be:
/WordPress-Android/
 /app/
 /workpress-sdk/</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">What I was thinking here was that there are sure to be people out there that need to use wordpress in their own app and instead of them copying this code out of the repo into their own app they could just fork this repo and use it as a library.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">This way any bugs they fix or extensions they make could be pushed back for others to use and likewise any changes made to this repo they could also easily leverage.</sentence>
