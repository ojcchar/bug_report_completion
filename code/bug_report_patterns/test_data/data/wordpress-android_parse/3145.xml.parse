		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">When the user tries to follow a blog by URL, the reader first does a quick GET request so see whether that URL is reachable before trying to follow it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Right now Volley is treating a 301 on this GET request as a failure.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Simple fix: treat 301 as success [here](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/blob/develop/WordPress/src/main/java/org/wordpress/android/ui/reader/actions/ReaderBlogActions.java#L375).</sentence>
