	<title>Load posts from wpDB method, clean up Post model</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I think one of the causes for #862 was that we are passing a localTableBlogId to the Posts model to load an existing post.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">There was no currentBlog, so the blogId was set to -1 and 'lost' in the database.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">We should simply pass a local post id to a method in wpDB that will retrieve the post.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">No need for the 'blogId' or 'isPage' parameters either.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">We could then remove the constructor in Posts.java that did database work.</sentence>
