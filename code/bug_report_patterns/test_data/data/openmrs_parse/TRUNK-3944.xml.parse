		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">We incorrectly include mockito-all, hamcrest-all and junit dependencies, all of which contain hamcrest classes.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">It causes problems in modules, which want to use different versions.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">We should be including mockito-core and junit 4.11, which only declare a depencency on hamcrest-core.</sentence>
