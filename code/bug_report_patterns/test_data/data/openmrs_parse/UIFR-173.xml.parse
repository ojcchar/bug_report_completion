		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Here's my wish list for changes to the new patient entry in the OpenMRS (in no particular order).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The identifier location drop down box should be eliminated.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">If the identifier is specific to a particular location, it should have a unique identifier type (ex.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">"Bobete Clinic ID number")</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">The "preferred" boxes next to name and address (in patient demographics) make sense but the "preferred" checkbox next to ID# should be eliminated (or explained).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">The date format for birthdate and regimen start/stop dates should be changed to match the country format we've chosen (dd/MMM/yyyy).</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">Since we're initially entering an age &amp; not a birthdate, the birthdate "estimated" box should be checked by default until the default birthddate is changed.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">The age should have have an error check for improbably high ages.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="8">
			<sentence id="8.1">Given that all identifiers of any given type are unique, a user should not be allowed to input an identifier identical to one that already exists.</sentence>
			<sentence id="8.2">(or there should at least be a warning)(see bottom comment)</sentence>

			<sentence id="11.1">The "allow verbose" checkbox should be eliminated (or explained)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="12">
			<sentence id="12.1">When in "edit patient" mode, there seems to be no way to get back to the previous screen w/ the tabs across reading "Overview, Regimens, Encounters etc."</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="13">
			<sentence id="13.1">"Closing" vs. "Voiding" a regimen is non-intuitive.</sentence>
			<sentence id="13.2">I'm assuming that the only reason you void something is because of an input error (I could be wrong), but if this is true, I would suggest changing it to "Discontinue" (which leads to inputs for 'date', 'reason' and 'save') and "Delete" (which should lead to a simple confirmation 'are you sure?</sentence>
			<sentence id="13.3">yes/no)</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="14">
			<sentence id="14.1">I've already discussed with you what I'd like to see to improve the initial redundant search screens but I'll reiterate here. I think it should be a single screen. At the top it should say "Find/Create Patient" and there should be input boxes for name, identifier number (and an identifier type drop down box w/ the default being 'not known'), birth year or age, and gender. The search results should pop up on the fly as any of these fields are filled out (though search results should not show more than say, 10 patients). Below the search results should be an "add patient" button. There should be a note below the button that says "Please be sure to fill in all fields before creating a new patient - ID type must be chosen." If all fields are not filled, and the user tries to create a new patient, an error message with the same text should appear. If the users inputted indentifier number already exists in the database, there should be an error message and the new patient should not be allowed. If the name already exists, there should be a warning that says "A patient with this name already exists in this database. Are you sure you want to create a new patient with the same name? (yes/no)" </sentence>
