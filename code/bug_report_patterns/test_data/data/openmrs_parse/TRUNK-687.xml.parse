	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Right now, address templating is not used in Data Export, so it's difficult to output a patient's address.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">This functionality should be hooked up to the AddressTemplate/LayoutTemplate framework so that it changes based on the address that you're using.</sentence>
