	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">AOP in modules was designed to be loosely coupled to the service class -- in other words, a module should be able to AOP around a class in a second module whether or not the second module is loaded.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">AOP between modules needs to be refactored such that AOP references to another module do not, by themselves, create a dependency.</sentence>
