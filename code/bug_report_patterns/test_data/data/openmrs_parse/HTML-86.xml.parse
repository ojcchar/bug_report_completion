	<title>htmlformentry: Support for UTF-8 characters in xml</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Not all installations of OpenMRS are able to successfully view accented characters in htmlforms.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">My initial feeling is that the success or failure is due to the default character encoding of the platform, which is used when reading/writing the xml to/from streams.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">We need to look into the mechanisms behind the xml processing and ensure that it is behaving consistently without dependency on underlying platform configuration.</sentence>
