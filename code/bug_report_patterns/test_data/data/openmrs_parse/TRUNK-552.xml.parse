	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">"I entered an incorrect patient identifier for a patient and saved.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I then went back to the same short form to edit the identifer and saved again, but going back to the form again there are now two identifiers (of the same type) with the old value and the new value respectively.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">When I click "remove" for the old one and save and then return to the edit patient screen it is still there!</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I can, however, remove the mistake identifier via the long form by voiding it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">However, it is intuitive to assume you can do this with the short form also the way it is set up."</sentence>
