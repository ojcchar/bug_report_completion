	<title>the Obs method getValueAsString(Locale locale) needs improvement </title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I have two complaints about this method.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">First, if the obs value is numeric, the string generated should respect the 'precise' property of the related ConceptNumeric.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Second, the default date formats shouldn't include commas by default -- these are the default column separators in csv exports, and it makes this method less useful if you're designing a data export.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">I think for dates yyyy-MM-dd would be more generally useful.</sentence>
