			<sentence id="2.1">If it is fast enough, by default a new db should be used every time someone executes jetty:run.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">If the user passes in a flag to jetty:run specifying the foldername for the files, the in-memory db could reuse that (or create a new if it isn't there)</sentence>

		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">See conversation here: http://listarchives.openmrs.org/In-memory-database-for-development-mode-td5459996.html</sentence>
