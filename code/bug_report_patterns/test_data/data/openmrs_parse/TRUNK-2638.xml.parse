	<title>adding drug as an answer to a coded concept</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I am attempting to add an additional coded responses to 2 questions (concept# 2154 and 2157).</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I would like to add concepts# 6964 ("TDF 300 AND 3TC 300 AND EFV 600"), 6965("3TC 150 and D4T 30"), and 6156("RALTEGRAVIR 400mg").</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">The issue is that each of these drug concepts is already listed as a coded response for these questions, in their original form.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I would like to add them each another time, this time using one of their synonyms as the response.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">So, for example, concept# 6964 would be available twice, once as "ENOFOVIR AND LAMIVUDINE AND EFAVIRENZ" and another time as "TDF 300 AND 3TC 300 AND EFV 600".</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">When I try to simply add another concept# 6964 to the coded answer list again, the same way I would if I were adding it for the first time, nothing happens.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">I am assuming AMRS thinks that I am adding something that is already there, and thus does not duplicate it.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">I am not sure if I have to do this from the backend, using mysql, or there is an easy way to do it using the amrs user interface?</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Concept# 1250 may be a reference, because if you look you'll see that this question already has the coded responses listed in the way that I describe.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">I am assuming Ada did this one.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Thanks for your help!</sentence>
