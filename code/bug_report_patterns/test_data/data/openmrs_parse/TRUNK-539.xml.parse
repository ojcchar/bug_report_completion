	<title>Concept editing broken after concept name branch merge</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">If a concept name is created/edited, the main name is not saved as such.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Instead, it shows up as a synonym.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Possibly related to this is that if I try to edit a concept that has an obs attached to its concept name id, then I get a "cannot delete name" error.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">The service might be trying to delete the name because of the above error.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">If it is not caused by that, concept names should not be deleted.</sentence>
