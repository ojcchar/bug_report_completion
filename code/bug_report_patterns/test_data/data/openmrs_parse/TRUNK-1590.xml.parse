			<sentence id="3.6">&gt; 1 get your module's log4j into the classpath and hope that the logging mechanism picks it up.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.7">Try putting your file into either the lib folder or change your build.xml so that the log4j.xml file is included in the root of your omod/jar file.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.8">&gt; 2 change the module loading hierarchy to look at and read the log4j file and copy its contents into some other log4j file.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.9">(similar to how either messages.properties or dwr.xml are done)</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.14">&gt;&gt; I read the information on the wiki about how to get logging to work with my unit tests and everything is working great.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.15">However, I want my module to create a custom log file through the openmrs webapp as well which it doesn't.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.16">Do I have to edit the actual log4j.xml that goes with openmrs or is there some configuration where I can just include a log4j.xml in the omod file that will override the openmrs logging?</sentence>
