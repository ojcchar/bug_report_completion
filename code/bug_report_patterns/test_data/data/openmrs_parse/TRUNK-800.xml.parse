	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">The current Role Management screen (when editing a role) lists only _Parent Role_ relationships and suggests that roles inherit privileges from their parents.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">In fact, parents should inherit privileges from their children -- not vice versa.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Parents are a "group" of children and thereby inherit all privileges within that group.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">For example:
{code}"Physician" is parent to and inherits privileges from
    "Clinician" is parent to inherits privileges from
      "Provider" is a group of privileges
{code}
The Role Management (edit role) screen should be changed as follows:</sentence>
		</paragraph>

			<sentence id="3.1">* Change the caption for _Parent Roles_ to read (replacing _Clinician_ with the name of the role being edited):</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">"_Roles that contain (inherit privileges from) Clinician_"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">* Under _Parent Roles_, list all parent roles as links (instead of drag-n-drop interface).</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">Clicking on the parent role should jump to editing that parent role.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">Bonus points for using a javascript confirm dialog before losing changes to the current role.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">* Between _Parent Roles_ and _Privileges_, insert a _Child Roles_ with the caption (replace _Clinician_ with the name of the role being edited):</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">"_Clinician inherits all privileges granted to any roles listed here_"</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">* The new _Child Roles_ section should use the drag-n-drop interface to add/remove children for the role.</sentence>
