			<sentence id="1.2">Performance testing does not need to include this issue because the only delayed element is the Person Search widget, and it will be tested independently.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">The relationshipOffline.jsp page and the associated portlet needs to be tweaked so we can specify particular relationships to show up in the sidebar and make it easier to select Parent / Child.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Scrolling / looking for the relationship may be what is taking the most time.</sentence>
