	<title>Patient search does not support double-barrel first names</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I have had a problem with the search feature.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">If a person has two first names, the second name is not available for searching.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">For example if a person was called Sarah Lee Smith and her first name is "Sarah Lee" then if you searched for Sarah Lee Smith you would not find her, you would need to leave out the Lee or have made Lee a middle name when it was created.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">This has been a problem because the concept of a middle name doesn't really exist where we are working and many Rwandans have first names with spaces in them eg Jeanne de Dieu Habymana.</sentence>
