	<title>Make link to OpenMRS Book more prominent</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Good news: while we may not have yet gotten feedback on the book in the two months it has been around but not easily available, we are starting to get more requests (e.g., to our contact page and ITSM tickets) asking for a non-technical introduction to OpenMRS... so there are definitely people looking for it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Two things that could help: (1) make access to the book more prominent on the wiki/website and (2) create an equally obvious place to provide feedback on the book.</sentence>
