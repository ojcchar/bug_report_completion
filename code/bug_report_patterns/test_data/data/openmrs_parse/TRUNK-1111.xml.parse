		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">As a non-intrusive first step to fix the above bug, the attached patch abstracts the logic for retrieving the matching concept for a token name into it's own method.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This will allow modules to subclass this DAO (and re-use the all of it's complex logic for handing Critieria), but override this particular behavior.</sentence>

		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">Win - I'll commit this to 1.5.x, but I assume it should not go to trunk, but instead into the logic module, correct?</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">Can you do this?</sentence>
