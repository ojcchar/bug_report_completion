	<title>The user selected language to be persisted is not reset</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">At the start of the installation wizard, the user can opt to persist their selected language as the system default language, currently this is cannot be undone, once you check it the first time and unchecked again, it is still persisted.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Also after the installation is complete irrespective of the installation method, the home page is never displayed in the persisted language selected in the wizard, this is because the url the wizard redirects the user to doesn't add the 'lang' parameter</sentence>
