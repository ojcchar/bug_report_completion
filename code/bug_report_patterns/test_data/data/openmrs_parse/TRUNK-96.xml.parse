	<title>SourceId in class "ConceptMap" Is redundant</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I think maybe the property "sourceId" of class "ConceptMap" is redundant, because that property doesn't have the matching column in db table and also in ConceptMap there is already a property "source" of type "ConceptSource", so whether we can delete this useless property?</sentence>
