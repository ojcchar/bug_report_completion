		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">In version 3.2 something was added, that I missed for so so long: the
possibility to tell the formatter to indent empty lines, which is very
important.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">But this option is not respected, if I let Eclipse automatically add
unimplemented method stubs.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Could you please change that?</sentence>
