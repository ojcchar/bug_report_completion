			<sentence id="2.1">The XmlConstraintProvider used when a constraint is defined inside plugin.xml filters the constraints returned by getBatchConstraints() by invoking IConstraintDescriptor.targetsTypeOf(EObject).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">ModeledConstraintProvider does not perform this filtering, as a result modeled constraints are evaluated against all the model elements instead of the targeted types.</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">Reproducible: Always</sentence>

		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">1 Create a targeted Java constraint and set a breakpoint on its validate(IValidationContext) method</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">2 Add a reference to the Java constraint inside plugin.xml, note that context.getTarget() returns an EObject of the expected EClass and the breakpoint is only executed once</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">3 Add a reference to the Java constraint in a model.validation, note that context.getTarget() returns every model element and the breakpoint is reached multiple times</sentence>
