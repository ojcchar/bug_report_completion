	<title>Use diagram editor mapmode in ShapeCompartmentFigure and ResizableCompartmentFigure</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Now these figures use MapModeUtil class to obtain IMapMode instance but fail 
since it's used from constructor when they have no parent figure.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">This 
effectively results in default mapmode that is himetric.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">So when another 
mapmode is specified in diagram editor it is ignored.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Now inner scrollpane is 
configured to have a margin border that is very thick when diagram editor does 
not use himetric mode so compartment contents are visible only when parent node 
is very big.</sentence>
