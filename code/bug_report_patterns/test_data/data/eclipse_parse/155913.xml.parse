	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">- Typed in an identifier for an interface that didn't exist.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">- Quick Fix (Ctrl-1), accidentally chose Create Class</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">- I'm pretty sure I hit Enter twice but then was able to select Cancel</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">- Within the editor, I couldn't open the new class but I could no longer create it again because it already existed</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">- Checking the filesystem, the Java file was there</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.6">- Deleting the file fixed the problem</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">This seems impossible given two Enters should have exited the dialog so I'm wondering if there was a timing issue where I was able to interrupt registration of the new Class after the file was created.</sentence>
