	<title>Shallow flag passed through on move</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">If you call IFileStore.move and pass in the SHALLOW flag, it should be ignored.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">The LocalFile implementation of move sometimes calls super.copy and passes through the same arguments, so it's possible to get SHALLOW semantics during a copy.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">The shallow flag should not be propagated from move because it is not a valid parameter for the move method.</sentence>
