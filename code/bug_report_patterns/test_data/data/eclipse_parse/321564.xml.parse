	<title>[Dialogs] '&lt;' in Open Resource not working as expected</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I20100802-1800.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Add these files:
A.t
A.text
A.txt
Alfie.txt
r.txt
read.ext
read.txt
reada
reada.eat
reada.ext
readaction</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">1 Enter "read.ext&lt;" into the dialog</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">==&gt; also matches reada.ext.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.1">2 Enter "A.t&lt;" into the dialog</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">==&gt; matches more than just A.t</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.1">3 Enter "A.te&lt;" into the dialog</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">==&gt; matches A.text, expected: no match</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="6">
			<sentence id="6.1">1 is a bug while 2 and 3 could be argued to work as expected but personally I think it is more natural to treat the '&lt;' as switch for using exact matching.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="7">
			<sentence id="7.1">Besides that the help needs to be updated and also talk about the file extension matching a bit more.</sentence>
