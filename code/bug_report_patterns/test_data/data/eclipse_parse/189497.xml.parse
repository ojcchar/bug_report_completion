	<title>Adding a java breakpoint exception should enable it</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">3 3 rc3</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Adding a java breakpoints that is already in the breakpoint list but disabled, should re-enable it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">- go to the breakpoints view</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">- click "add a java exception breakpoint"</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.6">- select NullPointerException, notice that an entry is added to the view</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.7">- in the view, disable the added breakpoint</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.8">- click "add a java exception breakpoint"</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.9">- select NullPointerException, notice that an entry is not re-enabled.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">This is pretty annoying since even though I may at one point have disabled the exception breakpoint, when I go back to the "add a java exception breakpoint", it is that I want this breakpoint to be enabled.</sentence>
