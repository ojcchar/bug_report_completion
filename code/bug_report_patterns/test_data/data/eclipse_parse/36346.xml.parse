	<title>Linux Motif zip file on download site contains symlinks</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">The zip file for Eclipse SDK 2.1 on the download site contains the following
entries:</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">eclipse/libXm.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">so           12
  eclipse/libXm.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">so.2         12
  eclipse/libXm.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">so.2.1  1915756</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The libXm.so and libXm.so.2 entries should be symlinks to libXm.so.2.1, but zip
files don't do symlinks so they get extracted as normal files.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">This means that
launching eclipse fails with a bizarre error (java.lang.UnresolvedLinkError,
referencing libswt-motif-2133.so, later referencing libXm.so.2), even after the
Eclipse install directory has been added to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">This bit me for a couple of days until I noticed the error.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">The solution for me
was obviously to remove the standard files and replace them with the intended
symlinks, but perhaps the Linux downloads should be tar.gz files instead of zip
files?</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">Either that or the offending files should be removed from the zip file
and some comments added to an installation document somewhere.</sentence>
