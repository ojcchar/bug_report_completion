	<title>Builders returning null scheduling rule can't work safely with other builders overriding #getRule()</title>

&gt; Apart from the NPE there seems to be no good reason why null should not be

			<sentence id="2.1">There's a problem with relaxing scheduling rules, and allowing some builders to return null.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">If the project contains a combination of builders:</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.4">(2) at least one specified a scheduling rule</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.5">The build will fail, as the build MultiRule representing (2) doesn't contain the resources which will be modified by the builder (1).</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">The problem with the API is that builders (1) &amp; (2) don't know anything about each other.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">Builder (1) is using the API to be as flexible as possible -- don't lock anything -- and Builder (2) wants some subset of the tree to be locked.</sentence>
