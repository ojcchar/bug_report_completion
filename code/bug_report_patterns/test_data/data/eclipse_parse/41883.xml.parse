		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I was modifing some files when Eclipse crashed (dealock).</sentence>

restarting, the outgoing changes in one of the projects I was working on did 
not appear in the view.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">Refreshing the subscriber did not help (not 
surprising).</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Selecting the refresh view from the view menu fixed the problem.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">I can't understand why the outgoing changes didn't appear in the first place 
since the files were decorated properly in the navigator.</sentence>
