	<title>[theme] improvements to task list synchronization to reduce load on servers</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Imagine a corporate setting where a lot of developers might all start Eclipse and nail the server at the same time.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">I know Mylyn synchs on startup, but does it start the "20 minutes" at the point that the first synchronization stops?</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.3">If it does, then that would at least build a little variation into everyone's clocks so that every 20 minutes the server does not get nailed again.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.4">Likewise, have you considered adding a small amount of fudge to the interval?</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.5">Like some smallish random interval added to the 20 minutes.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.6">I'd suggest some number between 1 and 120 seconds to create some variation?</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.7">It might be useful to also do this at startup, although personally I wish Mylyn just waited the 20 minutes before it did the first synchronization.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Finally, can a repository provider specify a minimum interval?</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">So that users cannot specify something like 1 minute as their interval and stress the server?</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Since Mylyn runs in the background, a user might not even realize how much they are hurting the server performance.</sentence>
