			<sentence id="2.1">Just for fun (seriously), I saved a feature editor with no version.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Closed the editor, and opened it again.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">It appeared that the editor wrote the contents to the file system.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">There were no errors during the process, nothing in the error log, and nothing in my problems view.</sentence>

			<sentence id="3.1">Upon opening the editor, the prior version showed back up.</sentence>

			<sentence id="4.1">This is a minor bug, I doubt people want to create features without version.</sentence>
