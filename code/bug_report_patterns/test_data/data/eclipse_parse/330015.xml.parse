	<title>[api] provide support for constructing task list subtask hierarchy from inward task relations</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">Using TaskRelation.parentTask (which is an INWARD containment) doesn't result in a sub/parent task structure in the task list.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">Only seems to be recognized by the quick outline.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">Outward connections are handled in SynchronizeTasksJob#synchronizedTaskRelations while nobody references TaskRelation.INWARD.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">I currently see no workaround if your repository only provides you with the inward information.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Any ideas?</sentence>
