			<sentence id="1.1">Win32 0412 Integration</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I am not sure how to describe the various problems I am now seeing since I 
have seen a variety of problems.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">However, they all seem to have a common 
theme.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">The underlying Java Model for a given class is not being updated 
properly as new methods are added or methods are changed.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="3">
			<sentence id="3.1">The two examples that I am consistently running across now are:</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.2">1 Search for a given method, and double click in the Task window to bring up</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.3">the java source.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.4">Add a new method to the file.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.5">I noticed that the Outline</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.6">view nor the Type Hierarchy were updated with the new method.</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.7">The subclasses</sentence>
			<sentence id="3.8">which did not implement the abstract method were not flagged with errors.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="4">
			<sentence id="4.1">2 Modified a method signature by adding a new parameter.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.2">I received two</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.3">errors in my task where classes were using the API.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.4">The first one was changed</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.5">without a problem.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.6">However the second one, when I try to use Context Assist,</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.7">the method is showing 2 parameters instead of 3, and the new API added above</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.8">does not appear as an option.</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.9">After closing the window with the added</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.10">parameter, the Context Assist is showing 3 parameters but the new method is</sentence>
			<sentence id="4.11">not appearing as a valid choice.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="5">
			<sentence id="5.1">Its almost like there are multiple working copies and what I see is the wrong 
one.</sentence>
			<sentence id="5.2">So when I close the window and re-open the file, everything is ok.</sentence>
