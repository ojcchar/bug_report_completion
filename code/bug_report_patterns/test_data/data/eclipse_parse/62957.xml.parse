normal severity.</sentence>

			<sentence id="2.1">Basically, the RAC (RAServer process) had been left running for a while on our
Linux_390 machine (enwlinx1) and when I went to do the latest M9 testing, I
found it in an extremely weird state.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">If you did a 'ps -eaf' to list the
processes, it wasn't listed in there by name, but was instead replaced by a
whole bunch of processes whose  name was "&lt;phi&gt;X" (where &lt;phi&gt; is replaced by
the ASCII extended symbol for phi).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">I'm attaching the servicelog (zipped up).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">It
looks like the RAC got into some infinite loop given the long string of repeated
messages.</sentence>
