	<title>launchShortcuts extensions generate warnings</title>
	<description>
		<paragraph id="1">
			<sentence id="1.1">I have launch shortcuts that use the new XML expression language.</sentence>
			<sentence id="1.2">But the 
extension point schema is missing this expression language, so the PDE 
generates many warnings in my plugin manifest.</sentence>
		</paragraph>
		<paragraph id="2">
			<sentence id="2.1">I'm assuming the schema for the XML expression language is fairly large, and 
this is why you didn't include it.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">Regardless of how you do it, I think there 
needs to be a way to avoid generating these warnings (other than filtering them 
out).</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">If it involves work for the extender, it should be documented in the 
schema documentation.</sentence>
