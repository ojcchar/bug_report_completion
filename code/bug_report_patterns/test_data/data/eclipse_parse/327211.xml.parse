			<sentence id="2.1">The bundles list on the artifact deploy page uses the same font for the bundle and the version.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.2">This isn't a problem for bundles that are named purely textually, but if the symbolic name has a number in it as well (e.g. JUnit4) then the numbers can run into one another.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.3">Representing the version number in a different font/color/style would help split the two apart.</sentence>
			<sentence id="2.4">For example, one could put the version number italicised in a dark green colour to help it stand out.</sentence>
