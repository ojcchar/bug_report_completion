    <title>DocumentRoot location on different partition fails</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I ran Apache after the RPM install with PHP and mod_ssl on Fedora Core 3 and it
worked great.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Then I changed DocumentRoot and the related Directory to
/public_html/www and attempted to restart the server.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Apache would not start.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">No results from the lsof -i:80 command, and no httpd.pif file comfirmed that.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">No error log is produced and no error message appears in the terminal.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">On my machine, /public_html is /dev/sda1 (SATA drive) and has a single partition
formatted as ext3 and mounted as /public_html.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">/public_html and /public_html/www
both have 755 as permissions.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Next I tried to get sneaky.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">I changed the DocumentRoot and Directory back to
/var/www/html (default).</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">Then I created /var/www/html.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.4">link, which is a symbolic
link to /public_html/www.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.5">Then I ran apachectl startssl and renamed
/var/www/html.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.6">link to /var/www/html and renamed the actual folder /var/www/html
to /var/www/html.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.7">old.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Well, it was sneaky, but it didn't work.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">I got the 403 error with "You don't
have permission to access / on this server."</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">I am able to change the DocumentRoot to other directories under /var.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">What it seems to boil down to is that I can't change DocumentRoot to a location
on a partition other than the one where Apache is installed.</sentence>
