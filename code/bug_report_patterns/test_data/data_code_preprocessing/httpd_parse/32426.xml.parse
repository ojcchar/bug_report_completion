    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Setting AuthLDAPRemoteUserIsDN causes require user to behave like require dn
and need
require user &lt;dn1&gt; &lt;dn2&gt; ...
rather than
require user &lt;uid1&gt; &lt;uid2&gt; ...</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">I'm looking at the code, It seems mod_auth_ldap.c sets r-&gt;user = req-&gt;dn around
line 360 and commenting it out fixes the problem.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">I guess, somewhere the REMOTE_USER to be passed as an environment variable is
being confused with the UID provided by the remote user.</sentence>
