            <sentence id="1.1">Why is the open_logs hook run before the post_config hook?</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">I am working on the mod_log_sql module (new maintainer), and have some code in
the post_config hook to assign global defaults ( i have a global per module
config structure as well as per server configuration) if they have not been set
by a configuration directive that need to be setup BEFORE the initial connection
to the database called in open_logs.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">However after placing many APLOG_DEBUG and
step by step gdb debugging, I find that post_config is called after open_logs.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">I'm thinking that this is a bug as it makes much more sense to call post_config
before open_logs.</sentence>
