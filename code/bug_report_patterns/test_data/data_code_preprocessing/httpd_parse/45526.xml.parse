    <title>PDF documentation is not properly searchable due to improper use of underscores</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">In the PDF version of the Apache HTTP Server Documentation, many instances of the underscore character (_) are converted to a space character with underlining turned on.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The practical implication is that the documentation cannot be searched for any term that includes an underscore, making the PDF version much less useful.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">For example, searching for "mod_cgi" using Adobe Reader 9 returns no results.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">This should be fixed by using real underscores, instead of using typography to simulate that character.</sentence>
