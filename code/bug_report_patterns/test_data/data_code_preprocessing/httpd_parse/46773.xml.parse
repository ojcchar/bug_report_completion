    <title>SSLClientVerify directive not processed in documented directory order</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The configuration directives for Directory containers are supposed to be processed in order of shortest to longest, to allow a general configuration to be overridden by more specific subdirectory directives.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">In the configuration below I have specified 'SSLClientVerify require' globally.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">In the registration directory, where we cannot yet have it protected, I have specified 'SSLClientVerify none'.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">I expected that to override the higher level directive and allow this subdirectory to be accessed without a client certificate.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">Instead, it still requires a certificate to be presented.</sentence>
