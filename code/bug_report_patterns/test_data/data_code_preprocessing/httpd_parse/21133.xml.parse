    <title>Apache allows an underscore in hostname</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">I foolishly used an underscore in the ServerName parameter which had me beating
my head against a brink wall as IE was giving mr grief about session cookies.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">This wasn't picked up by bind because of the wildcard DNS.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Should apache check that the DNS name passes some basic checks?</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">I appreciate
that the rules around DNS are complex but perhaps a few basic checks might help
out brain dead people like myself who forgot about the underscore rule.</sentence>
