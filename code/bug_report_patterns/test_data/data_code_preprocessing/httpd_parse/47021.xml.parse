    <title>A new MPM (security) and mod_selinux module</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">We intend to execute web-applications under the restrictive privileges (necessary minimum, if possible) to prevent system resources are unexpectedly accessed using buggy web-applications.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The new MPM (security) spawns a one-time process for each connection, and it gives third-party modules a chance to assign individual privileges prior to invocation of content handlers.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">The existing MPM reuses a process or thread to handle multiple requests more than once.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">It gives us benefit from the perspective of performance, but it also gives us a headache issue.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">Some of enhanced security mechanism (such as SELinux) does not allow processes to revert its privileges, even if it is dynamically changed, so it means we cannot reuse a process which already handled a request at least.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">The mod_selinux is a proof of concept.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">It assigns individual security context (privileges in SELinux) based on the result of http-authentication, prior to the invocation of web-application but after the authentication.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">The MPM is implemented based on the prefork with a bit of hacks.</sentence>
