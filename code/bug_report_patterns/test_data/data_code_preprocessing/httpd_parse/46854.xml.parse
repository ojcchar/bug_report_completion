            <sentence id="2.3">Wanted to subscribe to the mailing list to ask what I have done wrong in setting up Apache, but the list server bounces back its confirmation mail,  I tried 'reply' as it suggested,  I then did cut and paste and sent it, as it suggested, and then I used the variation at users-request with the subject set to the reply address the mailing list provided, and that bounced too.</sentence>
