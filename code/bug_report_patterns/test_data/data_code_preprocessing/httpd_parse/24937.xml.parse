    <title>Again: win32 Apache 2.0.48 build broken!!! missing ssl-std.conf</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Fix for this bug mentioned in http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24329 is not quite good, because it caused that ssl-std.conf which is 
produced by Makefile.in contains improper symbolic part of paths 
(pseudo_variables fo 'configure' utility on unix platforms) rather than real 
paths.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Following patch (tested on the real installation of Apache2.0) makes (I hope) 
better solution and is symmetrical for httpd-std.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">conf.in, httpd-win.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">conf pair.</sentence>
