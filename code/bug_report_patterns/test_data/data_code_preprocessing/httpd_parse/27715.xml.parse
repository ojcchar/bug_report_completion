            <sentence id="1.1">Some clients (for ex.: wap browser in motorola phone) insert spaces around "="
in "Range:" header, and send something like "Range: bytes = 0-100", but apache
understands that header only if it's written without this spaces.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Apache 2.0 has the same bug.</sentence>
