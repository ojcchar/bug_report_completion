    <title>[patch] Handling of SSL errors on non-HTTP connections</title>

        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I'm developing an Apache 2.0 module for EPP (see
http://sourceforge.net/projects/aepps), which also utilizes mod_ssl.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">The calling
patters thus are likely to be different than with HTTP.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Problem description: When the SSL-negotiation fails (missing client cert, server
config error, ...), the connection is closed TCP-wise, but this is not
communicated to the connection handler, and any further reads (i.e.
ap_get_brigade) will cause a core dump.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">I've nailed the problem down to the state-handling of an abandoned connection.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">In ssl_io_filter_input there is the following code-fragment:</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">if (f-&gt;c-&gt;aborted) {</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.4">/* XXX: Ok, if we aborted, we ARE at the EOS.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.5">We also have</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.6">* aborted.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.7">This 'double protection' is probably redundant,</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.8">* but also effective against just about anything.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.9">*/</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.10">which makes a lot of sense.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.11">I seem to run into a case where c-&gt;aborted is not</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.12">set even though the connection has been aborted.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.13">The error seems to be within</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.14">ssl_filter_io_shutdown, where c-&gt;aborted is *not* touched (in my case, nobody is</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.15">setting c-&gt;aborted to true).</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.16">The following patch seems to fix the problem for me:</sentence>

            <sentence id="5.1">return APR_SUCCESS;
