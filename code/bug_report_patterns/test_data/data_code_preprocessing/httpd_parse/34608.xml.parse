    <title>In mod_vhost alias %O not being parsed</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">One of my users who has a site hosted from mod_vhost_alias wanted SSI enabled.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">So I did what I though was the sensible thing</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">This did not work, I had to actually create a directory for the site itself</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">This properly enabled SSI for that site.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">However, it kind of defeats the purpose of mod_vhost_alias if the Directory
directive won't interprete %O. I'm imagining it has something to do with
Directory configurations at startup vs at request time.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.2">I could not find any
documentation on what is allowed here.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">This is probably more of a feature request but it felt like a bug when I was
chasing it.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">I think the Options and Overrides do take effect here but have not
tried to prove this yet.</sentence>
