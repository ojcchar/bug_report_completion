            <sentence id="1.1">Over the past years Apache has crashed several times every hour.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">I've been running Apache 2 since 2.0.40 and now we're up at 2.0.61 and still
experiencing these crashes so I guess it's about time I report this bug.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">I saw someone else having a similar problem here.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">There was an open bug about
random crashes in crc32 and bndm, but with Apache 2.2.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">I've tried to log the PID along with the HTTP requests into a logfile and
grepping out the PID after the crash but I guess the thread crashes before the
log is written since I'm not finding anything interesting there.</sentence>

            <sentence id="6.1">I've not been able to reproduce this but it keeps happening several times each
hour.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.2">Since we've got a fair share of traffic to this host I can't really gdb
Apache and wait for a crash and see what's going on.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">It might be a memory corruption since we're getting crashes in other places
aswell.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">It's not likely to be a hardware problem since the box have been
replaced two times already (for performance reasons) and the crashes have
continued on the new hardware aswell.</sentence>
