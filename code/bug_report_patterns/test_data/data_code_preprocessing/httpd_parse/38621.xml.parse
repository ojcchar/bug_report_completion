    <title>worker MPM doesn't respect graceful stop timeout</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The worker MPM code lacks a bit of code from the prefork MPM that would allow it
to respect the GracefulShutdownTimeout value.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">If the default value of zero is
used, the code works, but if a non-zero value is supplied, it is not respected
and a non-graceful shutdown begins immediately.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">A patch is supplied to copy
over the necessary lines from prefork.c to worker.c.</sentence>
