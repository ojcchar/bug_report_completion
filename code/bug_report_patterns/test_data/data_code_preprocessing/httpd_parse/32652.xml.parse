    <title>mod_ssl: match hostnames against subjectAltName DNS names too</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Contrary to popular believe and contrary to the apache documentation, it is
currently possible to use name virual hosting over ssl as long as all virtual
hosts share the same ssl-setup (server-certificate, client-certificates, etc).</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Using the subjectAltName extension of x509 v3 it is possible for this one
server-certificate to be valid for all ssl-virtual hosts.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">subjectAltName is
supported at least by current Mozilla browsers and Internet Explorer versions.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Look at http://www.es.net/pub/esnet-doc/SubjectAltName.pdf (found via Google)
for more details.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The setup works perfectly with Apache 2.0.52 (Debian Package), even though
apache complains once per virtual host about the CN of the certificate not
matching ServerName.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Please change the documentation or at least include a hint that subjectAltName
exists, it could be very usefull for small sites.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">It could also stimulate
browser support for subjectAltName if it became widly known.</sentence>
