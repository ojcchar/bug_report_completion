    <title>Mailmerge print page size 4.3.0 regression</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I have a Writer form set up for a #6 3/4 envelope with database fields to fill in.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When I try to print the form with mail merge fields Writer appears to select the default paper size of the printer (usually 8.5 x 11) instead of using the actual document page size.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">If I print just the form - with no data - it correctly selects the envelope size.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Am I missing a new setting or something - or is this a regression?</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">I hope it is not a new feature :))</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">I have reverted to 4.2.6 and it works as expected.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">- always sends the formatted page size to the printer.</sentence>
