            <sentence id="1.1">Created attachment 113682
Sample document - click on any field and mash keyboard, watch chaos ensue</sentence>

            <sentence id="2.1">To replicate:</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">1 Create multiple variables.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">2 Insert multiple input fields for those variables in close proximity to each other (within 1-3 lines or so).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">3 Click on one of the fields and type something in.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">OR</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.6">3 Insert a variable field for one of these variables elsewhere in the document, double-click on that and edit it.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">Current behavior:</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">Characters at the beginning and end of nearby(?) input fields get deleted, "pushed out" of the input field and turned into regular text, or replaced with "!!br0ken!!", or some combination of the foregoing.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Sometimes this starts happening even while inserting the input fields.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Expected behavior:</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">Editing one variable should never affect any other variable.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.3">Inserting input fields outside of an input field should not affect either old or new input field's variable.</sentence>

            <sentence id="6.1">Operating System: Windows 7 Professional
Version: 4.4.0.3 release
Last worked in: 4.1.6 release (possibly 4.3?</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.2">- definitely did not exist before inline input fields were introduced in any event)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">Severity marked as "major" as this completely breaks numerous templates I have - I can re-do the template as to get rid of all input fields, but the end effect of that is that I can't use input fields at all.</sentence>
