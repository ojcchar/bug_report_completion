    <title>FILEOPEN: Wrong page break in Microsoft docx file (caused by different handling of paragraph setting keep with next ?)</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Created attachment 122472
Paragraphs are wrongly moved to the second page</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Writer starts the second page with the paragraph 
"Ut tincidunt volutpat ..." and leaves enough free space on the first page to put this and the next paragraph on it.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Probably because all paragraphs have 'keep with next paragraph' active it decides wrongly and prefers to keep the paragraph at the end together instead of those in the beginning.</sentence>
