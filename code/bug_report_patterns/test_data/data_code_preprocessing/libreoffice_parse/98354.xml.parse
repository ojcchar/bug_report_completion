    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">After entering numbers direct in cells like:
C2: 1,1
C3: 2,2
C4: 3,3
C5: 4,4
and in the next cell
C6: =SUMME(C2:C5)</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">the sum is 0 !!!</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">The edit line shows for all cells the same characters as in the cell.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Opening the file with LibreOffice Version: 4.4.7.2 the content of the cells are identical but in the edit line all numbers have an inverted comma as first character:
C2: '1,1
C3: '2,2
C4: '3,3
C5: '4,4
That's the explanation for the sum.</sentence>
