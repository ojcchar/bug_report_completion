Presentation with a simple table to reproduce the bug</sentence>

            <sentence id="2.1">Selecting all cells in the table from the attached presentation and trying to add black borders (e.g. the top border) does not work if one does not click inside the table after clicking OK.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Clicking outside of the table in an empty area results in no border being added at all.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">This is reproducible with any presentation, be it simple or complex, not only with the attached example.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">If you do not select the whole table but only a few cells, you can get weirder behaviours, like some grey borders being added and others not.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">(In any case, there is another probably related issue: even if you click on the table so that the border appears, it is not reflected in the Cells formatting dialog.)</sentence>

        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">This behaviour feels completely non-deterministic to any user except fools like me who try one hundred times until they get the desired result.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">This is very frustrating until you get the workaround (clicking inside the table).</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.3">For most users, borders will feel broken, period.</sentence>
