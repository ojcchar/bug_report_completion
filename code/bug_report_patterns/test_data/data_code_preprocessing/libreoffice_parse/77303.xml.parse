    <title>LibreOffice starts frozen when creating untitled document from commandline</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">If I try to create a new, untitled writer document or web document from the command line with "libreoffice --writer" or "libreoffice --web" the splash screen works fine, and the window menu bar and window decorations come up, but nothing else does, and it gets frozen that way.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Editing an existing file works just fine, as does simply doing "libreoffice" and using the mouse to select a document type (though using "libreoffice" and trying to use a keyboard shortcut causes the document chooser UI to freeze up).</sentence>
