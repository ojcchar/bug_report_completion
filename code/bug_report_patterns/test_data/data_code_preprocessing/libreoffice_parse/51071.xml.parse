        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">As soon as there is more than 1 table in the spreadsheet, the CSV save-as target becomes very error-prone.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">1 Create new spreadsheet test.ods</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">2 Create a table table1 with content A1=ABC</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.4">3 Create another table table2 with content A1=123</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.5">4 Open table2</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.6">5 Save as test.csv</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.7">6 Warning is shown that only the current table *was* saved</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Current behavior: Only the currently opened table is saved, whenever "Save" is chosen.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Expected behavior: There should be an error message on each save, saying that only the current table was saved.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">Better would be to prevent the "save as csv" option altogether and add an "export to csv" option.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.3">The current implementation makes losing data very easy, because users might expect all tables to be saved.</sentence>
