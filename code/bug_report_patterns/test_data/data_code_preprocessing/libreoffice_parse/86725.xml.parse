            <sentence id="2.1">I've discovered two instances where lots (or all) of the comments I've added to my spreadsheet disappear.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">First, if I edit the sentence at C:43, "SENAST KOLLAD 23 NOVEMBER" to "SENAST KOLLAD 26 NOVEMBER" by only changing the 3 to a 6, then save the document, close it, and reopen it, all the comments are gone.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">Actually, if I change it at all, the comments disappear in this way.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">If I just add in the text "blabla" somewhere, save, close, open, the comments are all gone.</sentence>
