    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">In release notes there is a statement that "Data Pilot" name has changed to "Pivot Table".</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">How to reproduce:
Select menu Data | Pivot Table | Create and in the title there is name "Data Pilot".</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">So in Data menu is "Pivot Table", but when dialog opens there is "Data Pilot".</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">I think there should be single name used to minimize confusion.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">If the name has been changed then dialog name should also be "Pivot Table".</sentence>
