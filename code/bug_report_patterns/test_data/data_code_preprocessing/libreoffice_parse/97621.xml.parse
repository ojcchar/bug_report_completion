            <sentence id="2.1">I already tried removing and reinstalling without luck.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">No problems in any other programs, and I've now installed the older 4.4.7.2 version and there it works fine as well, so it must be something specific to 5.0.4.2.</sentence>
