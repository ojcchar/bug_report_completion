    <title>FILEOPEN: XLSX - Conditional Formatting rules not imported correctly</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The green data bar lines mentioned in bug 90511 didnt get fixed with the patches Markus submitted and i believe this to be due to the order of the rules in LO is different from how it is in Excel.</sentence>

        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">This maybe caused by the fact that C5:E30 and F5:F30 have multiple rules with the same range which appear above and below C4:E30 and F5:F29 with Excels rules list, while in LO they are all grouped under one entry in the manage conditional formatting dialog.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">I assumed this is the case, as deleting F5:F29 in LO fixes the problem.</sentence>
