        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Using on Mint17.2x64 and Win10x64.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Open Impress.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Listing of Master Slides (about 75) takes well over 35 minutes during which the program is completely unresponsive.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">Master slide previews eventually get listed.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">Try to select a master slide - nothing happens - menus are blank and the program cannot be closed.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">After 5 minutes the selected master slide appears on main window but program remains too slow to use.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.6">Each time I close and re-open Impress the master slide preview renews itself but I can still select a slide though I have no idea which one it is because the preview slides are busy renewing.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">OK, so I eventually get a master slide while preview list is regenerating (though I had to take a guess at which one I was selecting) but again during this time the program is unresponsive and menu items are blank.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">Also, again, I cannot close the program because the close dialogue box is also blank and I have to close the program via system settings.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">These problems do not exist with writer but are present in both Windows and Linux as mentioned above.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">Sorry to say that creating a slide presentation in Impress is simply not possible at present, at least for me.</sentence>
