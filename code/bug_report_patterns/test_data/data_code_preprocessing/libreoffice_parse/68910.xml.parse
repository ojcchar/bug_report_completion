    <title>EDITING: Wrong pasting websites from WikiTravel</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">If you go to any article at WikiTravel, e.g. http://wikitravel.org/en/Burma then select all text (simple ctrl+a) and copy it.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When you try to paste it to vim or TextEdit - works fine.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">If you try to paste it to LibreOffice or OpenOffice you get only some traces from additional frames, no main text at all.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">The problem is only when copying from Firefox, it works fine for Safari.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">However, there is a workaround.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">Switch to Web Layout and then paste and then the whole text is pasted.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">You can even switch back to Print Layout and it's ok then.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">The same issue also for "printable version" of the wiki's articles.</sentence>
