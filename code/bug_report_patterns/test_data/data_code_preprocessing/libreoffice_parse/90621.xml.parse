            <sentence id="3.6">6 Change the character style to one of the character styles in the drop-down menu.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.7">7 Close the dialog and update the bibliography if needed.</sentence>

            <sentence id="4.1">Remark: if the document, at this point, is saved as a flat ODT file and is examined in a text editor, the custom character style will be seen (text:style-name="_34__20_Style_20_name") in the text:bibliography-entry-template element for the book entry template.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">This might mean that the change is saved, but that custom character styles are not rendered in bibliographies.</sentence>
