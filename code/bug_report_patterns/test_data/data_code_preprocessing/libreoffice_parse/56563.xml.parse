    <title>Update install leaves relicts of old version</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The LibreOffice website recommends to update an existing LibreOffice installation on Windows by just over-installing the new version.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This usually works, but I experienced that the update does not thoroughly clean up some relicts of the old version.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">For example, if you updated from 3.5 to 3.6, the following 3.5 relicts will persist:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">1 The old installation directory (such as %ProgramFiles%\LibreOffice 3.5") is not deleted.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">2 If you had configured autostart for the old version, the corresponding "Startup" start menu entries are not removed.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">3 Several registry entries still point to the old LibreOffice installation.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">When you search the registry for "LibreOffice 3.5", you still find a bunch of according entries even after the update.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">You find even more when searching for "3.5" alone, but this will also yield some "false positive" entries that do not belong to LibreOffice.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">While this is probably not a bid deal in practice, I like installers to be thorough.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">An uninstall should clean ANY AND ALL relicts of the application, and an update install should do the same for the respective old version.</sentence>
