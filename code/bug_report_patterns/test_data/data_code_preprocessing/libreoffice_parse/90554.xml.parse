            <sentence id="1.1">Created attachment 114726
DOC with Charter BT font</sentence>

        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The attached document is not displayed correctly, because of the wrong spacing for "APPLICATION FORM" and "eGOVERNMENT MOBILITY SCHEME PROGRAM".</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Writer says "Charter BT; Cambria" but the documents looks better only when Cambria is applied manually or when Fonts Replacement Table is on with that replacement.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">I understand that there may be no font metrically-compatible with Charter BT, and Cambria may not be the real substitution, but that's still better then the original import.</sentence>
