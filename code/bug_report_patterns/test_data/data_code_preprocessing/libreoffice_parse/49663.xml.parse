            <sentence id="2.1">Problem description: 
I'm not sure if that's how I should proceed but I tried looking it up and found nothing.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">I had to force quit the app on my Mac but when I tried to open it again, the program came up with a notification asking if I'd like to restore the windows I was working on.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">I clicked both options, restarted the application, even reinstalled it but it seems to remember I force quit and won't restore or just ignore and move on.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">I can just toss the small window to a side, but I'd like to make it to go away for good and, of course, to actually work for if I need to restore something in the future.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">Thanks in advance, and sorry if I did this the wrong way.</sentence>
