        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">If I have an East-Asian character in my (predominantly English) document, followed by a quotation mark (opening or closing), the quotation mark takes the font settings from the "Asian text font" section of the style definition.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">This results in very ugly copy.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">1 Type some western text into LO Writer, surrounded by quotation marks (e.g. "sun").</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">2 Move the cursor to before the opening quotation mark, and type (or paste -- the IME is not relevant) an East-Asian character (e.g. æ—¥).</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Current behaviour:
The initial quotation mark takes the settings from "Asian text font" instead of "Western text font".</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">The behaviour is the same if a (normal-width, western) space comes between the East-Asian character and the opening quotation mark.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Expected behaviour:
The opening quotation mark, being surrounded by a normal-width space on one side, and a Latin letter ("s" in this case) on the other, should take the "Western text font" settings.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">The only way to "work-around" this problem is to select the characters that have been rendered incorrectly and manually force the application of the "Western text font" settings.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.2">Of course, this breaks if "Clear Direct Formatting" is used.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">It's not clear to me why typing an opening quotation mark immediately after an East-Asian character results in the insertion of Asian punctuation (e.g. ã€Œ or ã€Ž).</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">If I wanted Asian punctuation, I would, of course, type Asian punctuation.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.3">I don't know if this is connected.</sentence>

            <sentence id="10.1">I'm currently using LO Version 4.0.4.2 (Build ID: 400m0(Build:2)) on Linux Mint 14 amd64, but the problem has been around as long as I can remember and on every platform I've tried.</sentence>
