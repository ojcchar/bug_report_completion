            <sentence id="2.1">Steps to reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">1 open a document of a few pages</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">2 scroll with the mouse wheel</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">Current behavior:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">The redrawing due to scrolling is painfully slow.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">Additionally, all the scrolling gestures from the mouse wheel get queued and executed, no matter how long it takes.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">For example, if you quickly swipe your finger on the mouse scrolling wheel (typical fast-scroll gesture) up and down six times (which takes you less than a second), the page will keep slowing scrolling for about 15 seconds to reproduce each and every scrolling  movement with its corresponding redraw.</sentence>

            <sentence id="5.1">It looks like a jump into the 1980s.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">Expected behavior:
Scrolling should be fast.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.2">Modern computer CPUs and GPUs definitely provide enough computational power.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.3">Tons of applications with infinitely more complex-to-draw content scroll much faster than LO Writer.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.4">Operating System: Ubuntu
Version: 4.0.2.2 release</sentence>
