        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Hi, I have a couple of complaints about the tests.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Perhaps this should be multiple issues; let me know.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">1 They don't pass for me without applying [this patch](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/pull/1049/files) from @creack (I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 with the a 3.8 kernel and other docker deps installed.)</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">2 They are very slow -- it takes around 40 seconds for a full test run.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">Even running a single test with '-test.run' takes around 3 seconds because of the time to pull a docker image and start an http server.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">Ideally, the tests would be divided into unit and functional/integration tests, and running the unit tests would be a really quick and easy way of checking that your changes probably didn't break anything.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.7">3 Even though the tests (say they) pass, they produce [very noisy/verbose output](https://gist.github.com/cespare/b10a06efb3c5b1ef2a6b).</sentence>
