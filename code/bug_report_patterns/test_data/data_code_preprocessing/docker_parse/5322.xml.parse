            <sentence id="3.1">Nginx runs inside Docker listening to port 8080
Docker maps port 10000 to port 8080
HAProxy listens port 80 and direct /kibana to port 10000</sentence>

            <sentence id="4.1">The problem seems to be Kibana or Nginx "rewrites/accesses" the URL and so, the user browser indicates Kibana code attempts port 8080 instead of 80.</sentence>
