            <sentence id="2.1">You can get this error if you have a several hundred images on your host.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">I had ~450 images (as reported by 'docker images | wc -l') and when loading a saved image it would fail consistently w/ this error.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">This looks like it might be related to https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/092d52281d20e3456677ac11d781abf1cd0bdd8f/graph/load.go#L41 which constructs a list of all image IDs on the host which is then serialized to JSON and passed as an argument to a subsequent exec call.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">After deleting my images down to ~250, 'docker load' started working again.</sentence>
