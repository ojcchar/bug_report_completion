    <title>IP allocation doesn't take inactive containers into account</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">If a container was allocated an ip but then it exited, that ip may be reused by another container.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">If then the old container is started it will try to use the same ip, failing in weird ways (ip addr just hanged when testing this).</sentence>
