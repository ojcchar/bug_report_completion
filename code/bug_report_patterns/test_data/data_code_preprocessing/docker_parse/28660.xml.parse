            <sentence id="10.1">This command creates a folder "t123" containing "test" file on the host:
"'
$ docker run -it -v /c/Users/testing123/t123:/t123 alpine sh -c "touch /t123/test"

This command does not:
"'
$ docker run -it -v /c/users/testing123/t123:/t123 alpine sh -c "touch /t123/test"

Both commands create "t123/test" in the container and "/c/users/testing123/t123/test" in the "default" VM.</sentence>
