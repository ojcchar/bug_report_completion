            <sentence id="1.1">I was reading the code for CmdBuild and noticed that there's code there to replace '	' with spaces.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">this seems to me like an un-necessary breakage of expectations.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">so to test I made a simple Dockerfile:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">and yup, the test_tab.txt file has a leading space where the tab should be.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">now, while some, like @steakknife (see #522 ) might take issue with tabs :) I'm not sure there's a need to do this (anymore - again, due to #522).</sentence>
