    <title>`-h` inconsistency with dockerd/docker daemon</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">'dockerd' re-introduces '-h' as an alias for '--help' _in its help message_:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Not surprisingly, this is also the case when 'dockerd' is called as 'docker daemon':</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">And that's the point: all other 'docker' subcommands got rid of this flag in the help messages, so this introduces an inconsistency into the 'docker' command.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">Examples:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">The simplest solution would be to remove '-h' from the help message.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">A more sophisticated solution could check the name of the command being called and include '-h' only if the command were 'dockerd', but I dont't think it's worth the effort.</sentence>
