    <title>Throw error when `--lxc-conf` is used with native driver</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">To replicate: run the docker daemon with '-b none' but _not_ with any '-e' flag.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Expected behaviour: I think that docker run should reject any '--lxc-conf' option if the daemon is not using the lxc driver.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Test based on [this posting](https://goldmann.pl/blog/2014/01/30/assigning-ip-addresses-to-docker-containers-via-dhcp/).</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">Further discussion [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/docker-dev/hvs58JQ1vDs)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">(Aside: the lxc configuration is accepted when running docker with '-e lxc', but then 'docker exec' does not work with that driver!)</sentence>
