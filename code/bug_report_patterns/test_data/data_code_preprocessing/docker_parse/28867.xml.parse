            <sentence id="3.4">2 Inspect processes with formatting</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.11">3 In another terminal, ensure container is being listed</sentence>

            <sentence id="5.2">I would have expected that if the container can support the arguments being supplied to 'ps' then supplying them to 'top' would return the same results (which apparently was the case with issue https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/6482)</sentence>
