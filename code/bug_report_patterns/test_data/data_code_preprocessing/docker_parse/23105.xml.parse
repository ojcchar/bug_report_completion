    <title>OSX docker client fails to use keychain registered certificates</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Until https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14514 lands in go1.8, would it be possible to use https://github.com/hashicorp/go-rootcerts to make the docker client in OSX trust *all* the CAs registered in the system?</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">I'm running a private registry with an internal CA infrastructure and it's a pain to have to treat it as a special case in docker when all machines are set to trust that CA.</sentence>
