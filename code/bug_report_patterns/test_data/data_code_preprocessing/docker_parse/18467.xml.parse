    <title>Container Inspect does not return "Name" in "Mounts" for volumes created before 1.9.0</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Description of problem: when inspecting a container with api v1.21, a "Mounts" property is returned with the information about volumes.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Each "mount" has a "Name" property, which has a default value based on the volume source path.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">The issue is that this field is not returned for volumes created before docker 1.9.0, if the daemon is upgraded to 1.9.0.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">It does not look to be intentional, because these volumes are accessible by name, and their name is returned by the LIST Volume API.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.2">1 Create a container with volumes in docker 1.8.3</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">2 Upgrade the docker daemon to 1.9.0 (or 1.9.1)</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.4">3 Inspect the previous container and check the "Mounts" property</sentence>
