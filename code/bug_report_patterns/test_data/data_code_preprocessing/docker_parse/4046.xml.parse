    <title>REST API /commit no longer respects Entrypoint, Cmd</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Since I switched to v0.8.0, when committing a container via the REST API (`docker commit` but not `docker build`) at least the `Entrypoint` and `Cmd` parameters appear to be ignored.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When I was using v0.7.6 it worked correctly.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">I've talked to at least one other person on IRC who has the same issue.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">The same thing also happens when I make an API request directly via `curl(1)` instead of using the Docker CLI.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">In this example the `strace` output shows that `"Entrypoint": ["/bin/bash","-l"]` was sent to the server, but inspecting the resulting image shows `"Entrypoint": null`.</sentence>
