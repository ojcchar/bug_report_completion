    <title>Add the completion file to .deb package</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I installed Docker via https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">After installation, the completion file for Bash is not in '/etc/bash_completion.d'; I have to install it manually (with 'curl').</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">I think it should be installed by the package, or at least the completion file should be provided somewhere (so that I can symlink to it).</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">I searched '/usr/share/docker-engine/contrib/' but the 'completion' folder is not there.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Note: For Zsh I installed the completion in '/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/', but I guess (from folder name) that the '.deb' package should install the completion in '/usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions'.</sentence>
