            <sentence id="1.2">Now when I run make in the root of the repo I get the error in [1].</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">I believe this commit is the source of the problem:
https://github.com/dotcloud/docker/commit/37a78902db9e968d307d0c0325612e8bef20bc69</sentence>

        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Am I doing it wrong?</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">The build process is just checkout docker, install go if necessary, and then run make at the root of the repo?</sentence>
