    <title>docker pull ignoring https with 0.8.1 on OS X/boot2docker</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Note in the pull there it is trying to connect to http, not https.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">In my '~/.dockercfg' file, I do have the full URL (with 'https') in there.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Possibly related to #4267, #3956, #3683, and #3946.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">Unfortunately the workaround I originally used in #3946 for the SSL certificate problem -- ssh'ing into the boot2docker VM and running 'docker login' and 'docker pull' -- no longer seems to work:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="8">
            <sentence id="8.1">Not sure what's up with that... I can 'nc -v registry.example.com 443' fine.</sentence>
