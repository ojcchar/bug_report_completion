    <title>Ad Blockers block the install pages of applications</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">From my own experience and those of my users I ve found that ad blocking software can block the Add Application page by default (e.g. IE7 Pro s Ad Blocker).</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Users just get a blank white screen as the entire URL is blocked.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">I ve white-listed www.facebook.com/add.php just so I can install applications.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Perhaps renaming add.php to install.php or something may help out.</sentence>
