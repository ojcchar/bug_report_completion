        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1"> Your application Happy Easter (ID #105715982837718) has been detected by our automated systems and permanently disabled. </sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This is the message i got from Facebook just before. A message which is accusing me of spam. My applications are not spammy_ they are not generating posts. Only users can choose if they publish something on their wall or not. It s all up to the users. So there is no spam involved in my app. So why was my app accused of spam???</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">I create all the images for my apps_ that s why my apps tend to become popular very fast_ because of the new and original content. I am being punished for being creative... We_ as developers_ don t we have any rights? We are also Facebook users. How is it possible for an  automated system  to call me a spammer? I find this insulting. </sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Why am i reporting this as bug? Because it is a bug and somebody should really look into it. I had exactly the same problem last year with a newly created app. And after i send an appeal the app was reinstated. Last year i sent you a message describing exactly the same thing...and i was not the only one reporting this.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">And for a better understanding: i am an AppBank developer(my apps were created on the AppBank platform). I don t get a lot of income from this apps... the income is modicum. Not all of us developers make apps for income_ so please don t treat us all like we are trying to invade Facebook looking for the big bucks.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">I have another Easter app which i made 2 days ago(again_ new original content). I hope it will not suffer the same fate and get disabled. My reputation is affected as well. I suggest the app to friends_ they start using it and all of the blue the app disappears. How should i explain this to the people which were using the app? What should i tell them? That the app was disabled by FB and i was accused of spam??? We are also human beings_ we have feelings. Facebook is a social network_ so let us try and keep it  social .</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.7">Please somebody look into this.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.8">Thank you for your time.</sentence>
