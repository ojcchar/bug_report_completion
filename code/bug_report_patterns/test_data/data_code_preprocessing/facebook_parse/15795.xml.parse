    <title>fetching  platformrequests  using graph API is limited to 25</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Hi_ we use a scheme like below to fetch and delete platform requests_ i.e. invites.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">We have found the request to fetch these is limited to 25.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">This is problematic because we use these to determine the gifts to credit for the user.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Also_ when we do the DELETE it removes ALL requests so we can never give credit for any of those gifts above the 25 limit.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">Can you please confirm this and either allow returning ALL requests?</sentence>
