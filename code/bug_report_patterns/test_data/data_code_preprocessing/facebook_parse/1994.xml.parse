    <title>fb:swf tags loaded in a dialog can switch content while page is loading (before scripts are initialized?)</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When loading a YouTube video in a dialog window from the profile page (using fb:js-string for the dialog contents containing an fb:iframe with the YouTube video embedded)_ if the dialog is opened before the ads on the left side of the profile are loaded_ it can swap the flash ad for the embedded video.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This is causing (Facebook platform) ads to be displayed in our (iLike) video dialog instead of the video.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">It appears that it is the first fb:swf tag on the page that takes its place (and sometimes the YouTube video shows up in the ad space).</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">This repros quite consistently in Safari_ and sometimes on FF.</sentence>
