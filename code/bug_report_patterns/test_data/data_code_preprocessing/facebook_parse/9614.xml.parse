            <sentence id="3.1">This is a serious issue as many clients do not wish to prompt their users for email for policy reasons_ and doing this without the consent of applications_ and without any way for an application to turn the prompt off is definitely not an ideal situation.</sentence>

            <sentence id="4.1">Is this some sort of test that will last for a certain period of time?</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">Is there a new setting somewhere that will allow us to disable this prompt?</sentence>
