            <sentence id="1.1">I have an example of a multi-query in a batch request and then an example of a multi-query on its own.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The issue is the multi-query in the batch is not returning any results but the multi-query on it s own is.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Below are both the call and the result.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">I have removed the token to protect the innocent.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">I have also cut down the response for MULTI-QUEYR ONLY so that the bug is not so big.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">This was working before and now it has stopped in the last few days.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">The second issue is this is also not working for posts.</sentence>
