    <title>NonBatchingBatch releases statements twice</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">{{NonBatchingBatch}} in {{addToBatch()}} method calls {{jdbcCoordinator.release(Statement))}} for every statement, and then calls {{releaseStatements}} method which calls {jrelease}} again. It causes an exception in {{JdbcCoordinatorImpl.close(Statement)}}, and although the exception is caught it causes early exit and I think should be avoided.</sentence>
