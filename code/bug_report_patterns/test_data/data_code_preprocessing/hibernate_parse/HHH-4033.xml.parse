    <title>'where' filter for many-to-many relation does not work </title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When you add a filter using 'where' attribute for many-to-many relation, Hibernate uses column from the join table to create the the filter-condition.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This seems wrong.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">The filter should happen on the associated table.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">If where attribute is meant to do the filtering on join table, then we need another attribute so that filtering can be done on the associated table.</sentence>
