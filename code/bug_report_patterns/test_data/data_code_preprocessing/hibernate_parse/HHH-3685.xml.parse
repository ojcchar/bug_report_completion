    <title>Sybase - SchemaExport cannot create stored procedures in chained transaction mode</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">In order to create a Sybase stored procedure that can be executed in a transaction (not autocommit), either:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">1 the stored procedure needs to be created in a transaction</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">or 2) the system stored procedure, sp_procxmode, has to be called (sp_procxmode &lt;stored-proc-name&gt; 'chained')</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">SchemaExport executes DDL using autocommit, so Sybase stored procedures created with SchemaExport cannot be used in a transaction.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">It is not possible to run SchemaExport with autocommit=false.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">This causes the unit tests for Sybase stored procedures to fail with a message like:
"Stored procedure 'simpleScalar' may be run only in unchained transaction mode.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">The 'SET CHAINED OFF' command will cause the current session to use unchained transaction mode.'</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">A workaround is to add a &lt;database-object&gt; tag containing the command to change the stored procedure to chained mode.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">This tag needs to follow the tag that defines the new stored procedure.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">For example, adding the following after the definition of paramHandling in the mapping for SybaseCustomSQLTest will change the paramHandling stored procedure so that it can be used in a transaction.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">&lt;database-object&gt;
        &lt;create&gt;
        sp_procxmode paramHandling, 'chained'
        &lt;/create&gt;
