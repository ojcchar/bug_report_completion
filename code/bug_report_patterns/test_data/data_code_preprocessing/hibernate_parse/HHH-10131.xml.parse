    <title>CacheableFileXmlSource.doBind returns null instead of created binding when .hbm.xml.bin have not been created yet</title>

        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Using MetadataSources.addCacheableFile with a .hbm.xml file that exists but without a .hbm.xml.bin file (not created yet at this point) results in a null binding because of https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/5.0.1.Final/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/boot/jaxb/internal/CacheableFileXmlSource.java#L98.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">In the end it results in a NPE:</sentence>

        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Instead, I think that the binding should be returned after having been serialized (now the .hbm.xml.bin file exists).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">That is, "return binding" after https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/5.0.1.Final/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/boot/jaxb/internal/CacheableFileXmlSource.java#L95.</sentence>
