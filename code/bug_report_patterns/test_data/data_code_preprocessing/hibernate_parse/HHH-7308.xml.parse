        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">However, in certain cases (i.e the child session was closed()) the beforeTransactionCompletion() isn't getting called but the the afterTransactionCompletion() is.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">This caused an issue with Hibernate search where an exception was being thrown "Access a Sealed WorkQueue which has not been sealed" since the beforeTransactionCompletion() never got called.</sentence>
