            <sentence id="2.1">After upgrade to 4.1.1, our application doesn't work anymore because the sqlEntityIdByNaturalIdString field of the entity persister is null while it shouldn't be.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">The problem is that the new code requires the entityPersisters to be postInstantiate()d in a specific order namely the root entity persister should be initialized before the child classes (which is not guaranteed at all and is not the case in our application because of the way our classes are organized).</sentence>

        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">-&gt; if the root persister is not postInstantiate()d yet (which is our case here), sqlEntityIdByNaturalIdString is null and so is the one of the concrete class leading to fatal error when trying to execute queries using the natural id.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="8">
            <sentence id="8.1">In this case, we should force the postInstantiation of the root entity persister before using sqlEntityIdByNaturalIdString (or we should at least generate its sqlEntityIdByNaturalIdString).</sentence>
