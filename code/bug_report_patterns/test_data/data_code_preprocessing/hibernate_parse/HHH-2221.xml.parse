    <title>MySQL temp table DDL and isolation</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">On MySQL, temporary table DDL operations do not cause implicit transaction commits, even though the driver metadata reports that DDL does cause implicit transaction commits.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">The reason being that MySQL handles temp table DDL operations differently than non-temp DDL, which the JDBC metadata does not account for.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Thus, need a way for the dialect to unequivocally force the temp table DDL to be performed in the current transaction regardless of what the driver reports...</sentence>
