    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Query.list() return value (ArrayList) is wrapped in an unserializable RandomAccessSubList.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This is a java.util package private class.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Apparently the object graph also contains other instances of it, because when I tried to work around by constructing a Vector out of Query.list(), still ran into the same problem deeper in the graph.</sentence>
