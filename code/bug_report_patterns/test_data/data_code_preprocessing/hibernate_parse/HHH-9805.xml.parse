    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">We want to support H2 and PostgreSQL, so there is no opition with manually adding quotes around every identification.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">And we use flag hibernate.globally_quoted_identifiers=true instead.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">But it happen that it doesn't work for column names in @JoinColumn annotation!</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">as you can see all is quoted except : nID_Region
which in the end leads to exception.</sentence>
