    <title>Mapping gets confused if superclasses are in different packages. </title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Let's say because you use a mixture of generated and customized code, so that most of your classes are split into a generated superclass in one package, and a subclass that's where you put custom code.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">If you put the generated code in a different package, Hibernate will have issues with the mapping, such that it will miss the superclasses.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">This becomes obvious if you generate the metamodel, because it will omit "extends superclass" from the model.</sentence>
