    <title>&lt;list-index&gt; base attribute ignored on insert for a bidirectional association (one-to-many)</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">As you can see from the mapping, we have a parent entity ({{Parent}}) referring child entities ({{Child}} using the {{children}} accessor).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">The index column ({{ORDER}}) is not an attribute in the child entity, so I referred to the second use case in section _6.3.3.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">Bidirectional associations with indexed collections_ of the reference guide to do my mapping.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Everything works except for the index base, it is always 0 based on insert.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">I've tried both Hibernate 3.3.2GA and the latest development version (3.5.0-CR-1), the issue can be reproduced in both.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">I've joined a test case to reproduce the problem.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">While working on it, I realized there are updates after the inserts setting the correct index.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">However, we cannot change the database schema and there's a constraint on the index column enforcing a value &gt; 0.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.4">So this issue is really important for us.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.5">I could manually handle the index values, but it would be so much easier to let Hibernate do it.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">I've traced the problem and it seems that {{StatefulPersistenceContext#getIndexInParent(..)}} does not considers the index base.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">Why are updates necessary after the inserts?</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.3">It looks to me like Hibernate could correctly set the index parameter on the insert statements.</sentence>
