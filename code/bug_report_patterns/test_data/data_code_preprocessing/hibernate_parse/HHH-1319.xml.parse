    <title>Hibernate 3.1 does not analyze queries with a certain depth anymore</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">A query like the one
 from Dispo.Hibernate.Test.A as a where a.ptrB.ptrC.Oid &gt;= :oid
leads to a NullPointerException when using Hibernate 3.1.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">The same query runs without a problem against Hibernate 3.0.5.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">When breaking down the where clause to "a.ptrB.Oid = ptrC.Oid and ptrC.Oid = :oid" the query works.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">I'll attach the Java files I've used for this test case.</sentence>
