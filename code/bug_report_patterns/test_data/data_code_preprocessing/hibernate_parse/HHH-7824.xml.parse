    <title>All MySQL5 dialects generate incorrect sql when multiple tables in from clause</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Generated SQL when there is more than 1 table in the from clause immediately followed by an inner join results in incorrect SQL and this error:
Caused by: com.mysql.jdbc.exceptions.jdbc4.MySQLSyntaxErrorException: Unknown column 'recipeingr0_.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">unit_id' in 'on clause'</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">If this is modified to surround both tables in from clause with () then it is parsed correctly.</sentence>

            <sentence id="5.1">Described in the 5.0 manual here:
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/join.html
"Previously, the comma operator (,) and JOIN both had the same precedence, so the join expression t1, t2 JOIN t3 was interpreted as ((t1, t2) JOIN t3).</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">Now JOIN has higher precedence, so the expression is interpreted as (t1, (t2 JOIN t3)).</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.3">This change affects statements that use an ON clause, because that clause can refer only to columns in the operands of the join, and the change in precedence changes interpretation of what those operands are."</sentence>
