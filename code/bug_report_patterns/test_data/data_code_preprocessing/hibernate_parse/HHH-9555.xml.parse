in the below code, inside callback session.doWork , after Iterator it.next() the associated dataSource to wrapper connection WrappedConnectionJDK6@25f1d9ee becomes NULL, subsequently stmt.executeQuery fails with  exception "Connection is not associated with a managed connection.org.jboss.jca.adapters.jdbc.jdk6.WrappedConnectionJDK6@25f1d9ee".</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">We have configured JTA transaction manager, also aware of after_statement connection release mode, however same code with JTA transaction is working fine in hibernate versions 4.1.6 to 4.2.0.</sentence>

            <sentence id="2.1">Is this a new feature that now inside doWork callback we call not use connection (with JTA transaction) after Query.list/ Query.iterate.next or this is a longish bug?</sentence>
