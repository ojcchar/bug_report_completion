    <title>Illegal SQL generated for count distinct queries of embeddables</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">the following query generates illegal SQL if the entity uses an embeddable as primary key:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">This is just the simplest example for such a query. In reality the query is much more complicated and involves left joins (the reason for the distinct). It does not matter whether this is done in JPQL or as a criteria query.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">The generated SQL is not legal in Oracle:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.10">Trying to reformulate as e.g. {{distinct concat(field1,field2)}} fails in HQL. </sentence>
            <sentence id="1.11">For Oracle in particular the correct SQL should probably look more like:</sentence>
