    <title>Hibernate dynamic subclassing makes invalid class loader assumptions</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When using hibernate persistent types are "enhanced" using javassist proxying.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This proxying behaviour makes the assumption that javassist and hibernate internal types are directly loadable by the client's class loader.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">In some environments (for example OSGi) This isn't true.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The problem is here: https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-orm/blob/ec4f20a5fba79444dbd704f1305f961c339dd7d1/hibernate-core/src/main/java/org/hibernate/proxy/pojo/javassist/JavassistProxyFactory.java#L96</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">There is a related issue in Aries here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARIES-1534 but it would be best if the 5.0.x and 5.1.x Hibernate branches could be fixed</sentence>
