    <title>Incorrect date_created value on edited concept names</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When you edit a concept name via the standard OpenMRS UI, behind the scenes OpenMRS voids the existing concept name and created a new concept name with the new value.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">The problem is the date_created is set to the date_created of the old concept name, not to the current date.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">It should be set to the current date.</sentence>
