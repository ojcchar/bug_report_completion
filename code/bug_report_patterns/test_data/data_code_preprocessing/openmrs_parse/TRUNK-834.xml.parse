    <title>Found Similar People yields excessive results when adding a new person</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When adding a new person, the search for similar people includes too many results.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">The results for potentially duplicate patients should be refined.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">For example, when adding a new patient, Fred Flintstone, it comes up with 229 results in our system, including many names which are not even remotely similar.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">This also causes a significant delay while the list of potentially pre-existing persons is created.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">When searching for existing patient, Fred Flintstone (like we were going to view them in the dashboard), it yields no persons.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">This occurs in OpenMRS Version: 1.4.0.23 RC Build 7055.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.7">See a sample of the results below...</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">On a side note (which may or may not be related), the total number of potential matches changes.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">For example, as I advance through the previous and next pages, the top right where it gives the total number of results changes.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">For example, on one page it says... Viewing 16-229 of 363 on another it says... Viewing 96-229 of 243 on another it says... Viewing 36-229 of 403.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">It also fails to go back to the previous list to show the first group of persons.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Also, the group sizes are not uniform when advancing between groups of potentially duplicates.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">Sometimes it's 5 persons in the list, other times it's 20 or 30 or 70, or 105.</sentence>
