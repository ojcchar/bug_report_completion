    <title>PatientProgramValidator requires that all states in a patient program be in *non-retired* workflow in that program</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The PatientProgramValidator requires that for all patient states in a patient program, the state associated with each patient state must be in one of the workflows associated with that program.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">However, the validator only tests against non-retired workflows, which I believe is in error.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">It seems legitimately valid to retire a program workflow and it's program workflow states without voiding the associated patient program states, correct?</sentence>
