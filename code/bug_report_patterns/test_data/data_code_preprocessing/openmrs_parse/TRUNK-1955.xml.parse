    <title>Relationships lost when creating a new patient and results not refreshed</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">When a relationship is added when creating a new patient or with the Edit this Patient (Short Form), there is no confirmation that the relationship name has been accepted.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">If a patient has typed something in that box, it shouldn't allow the form to be submitted until the matching patient names has been clicked in the box.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">In some systems this may be obvious, but with the number of patients that we have, users will click through thinking it's a text field, and never know that the relationship wasn't recorded.</sentence>
