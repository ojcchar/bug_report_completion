        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">To reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">* Go the edit concept page</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">* Click "Add Mapping"</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">* Click Save Concept (without having actually chosen a term to map to</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">* You'll see the error message: "Only existing reference terms can be mapped"</sentence>

        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">My first thought is that the empty mapping should be silently dropped.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">An alternative would be to change the error message to "You must specify a reference term".</sentence>
