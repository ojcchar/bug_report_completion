            <sentence id="1.2">The web interface should be updated to not show the programs section, but allow the viewing of other items the user has permissions to view.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">As a temporary solution, we could consider adding "View Patient Programs" to all existing roles in the role_privilege table.</sentence>
