    <title>Incorrect behavior of Person.getPersonName() and getPersonAddress() for a voided Person</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">If a person is voided, then all of their names, addresses, etc are voided.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Thus calling getPersonName() or getPersonAddress() on a voided person returns null.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">And as a result Provider.getName() returns null if the provider points to a voided person.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">I propose that we add a special-case to the getPersonName() and getPersonAddress() convenience methods so that if the person is voided, we don't exclude voided names/addresses as candidates for being returned.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">(This caused a bug in production in Mirebalais, since we were not expecting Provider.getName() to ever return null.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">We have added a workaround in our code, so this is not pressing.)</sentence>
