    <title>Add SerializationException and ensure it is thrown by SerializationService</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Currently, the SerializationService and OpenmrsSerializer implementations throw APIException, which is a RuntimeException.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">It would be preferable for Serialization services to throw a SerializationException consistently upon any error during either Serialization or De-Serialization and for consumers deal with such exceptions.</sentence>
