    <title>Masterbar: user can remove the current site if it's self-hosted</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">As @maxme [points out](https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/pull/2569#issuecomment-96665374), if the current site is self-hosted the user can remove it via 'My Sites &gt; Settings'.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">The "My Sites" pages needs to be smart enough to handle this situation (right now it continues to show the self-hosted site that was just removed).</sentence>
