        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">My self-hosted test blog has the latest version of the Jetpack (3.9.6) plugin installed, but it is not connected to WordPress.com.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">When tapping the Stats option in the blog details screen, I see the stats activity appear and try to sync.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">Eventually it stops syncing and I'm prompted with an error that reads: 
"Jetpack plugin not found, The Jetpack plugin is required for stats.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Do you want to install Jetpack?</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">No / Yes" </sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">If I tap yes I'm taken to the Add Plugins page and I see in the list of plugins that Jetpack is _already_ installed.</sentence>
