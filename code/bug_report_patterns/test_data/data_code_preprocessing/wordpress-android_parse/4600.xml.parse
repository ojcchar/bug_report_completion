        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">When a WordPress.com user signs up on the web, they are prompted to confirm their email address at the end of the signup flow:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">!</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">If the user doesn't confirm their email address at that step, they are blocked from publishing new posts and see a notice/reminder in the Calypso editor:</sentence>

        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">Currently, those same users are blocked from publishing in the WordPress app as well, but the publish button isn't deactivated â€” their posts just inexplicably become drafts instead of publishing.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">(They often have to reach out to support for an explanation of what's happening and for help confirming their email address.)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="8">
            <sentence id="8.1">Instead, we should offer a similar notice/reminder within the app to help these users.</sentence>

            <sentence id="8.3">1 While logged out of WordPress.com, open https://wordpress.com/start</sentence>
            <sentence id="8.4">2 Sign up for a new account but don't confirm your email address</sentence>
            <sentence id="8.5">3 In the app, log in to your new account</sentence>
            <sentence id="8.6">4 Create a new post and try to publish it</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="9">
            <sentence id="9.1">Result: The post becomes a draft.</sentence>
