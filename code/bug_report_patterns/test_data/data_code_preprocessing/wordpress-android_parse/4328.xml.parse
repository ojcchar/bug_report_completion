            <sentence id="1.1">### Expected behavior</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">When searching in Switch Sites, the results show matches based on site title or URL - tapping the site you want should open that site's options
### Actual behavior</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">If the site _title_ matches your search string, the correct site opens.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">If the site _URL_ matches (but the title doesn't) the app will open the wrong site.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">In that case, if the site you choose from the results is the third in the list, the app opens the third site in the main Switch Sites list, not from your search results</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">### Steps to reproduce the behavior</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">1 In an account with multiple sites, find or create a test site that has a different site title than its URL (Example: '_This Is A Testing Site_' as the title and '_reallyobscurebug.wordpress.com_' for the URL).</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.4">2 Open the app and tap Switch Sites.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.5">3 Note the order of sites listed.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.6">Which ones are first, second, third, and so on.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.7">4 Tap the magnifying glass to search and enter a string that matches your test site URL, but not its title.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.8">In the above example you would use the first few characters of '_reallyobscurebug.wordpress.com_'</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.9">5 When your test site appears in the list, notice how far down it is (is it the first, second, third, etc., result).</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.10">6 Tap the test site to try opening it.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.11">7 Notice the site that actually opened - it will be the site from the corresponding position in the main Switch Sites list.</sentence>
