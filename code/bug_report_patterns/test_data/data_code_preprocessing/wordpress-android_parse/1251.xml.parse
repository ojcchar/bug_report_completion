    <title>"First" empty views should indicate the app is loading content</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Empty view says there are no posts while loading:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">- From Settings, show a blog that you havenâ€™t shown on your account before.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">- switch to posts and youâ€™ll see the loading indicator below the action bar.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">- screen will say â€œno posts, why not create one?</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">â€� which is clearly not the case because the app still hasnâ€™t finished loading them.</sentence>
