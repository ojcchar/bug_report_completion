    <title>Do away with "local changes" limitation in the post list refresh</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Right now the post list silently skips the automatic refresh if local changes exist, since those local changes would be overwritten during the refresh.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">This means that new posts will never appear during an automatic refresh if there are local changes.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">If the refresh was due to the user initiating a pull-to-refresh, the user is presented with this unfriendly dialog:</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">!</sentence>

        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Assuming the user understands this dialog, it means we're asking them to choose between seeing new posts and overwriting ones with changes that haven't been uploaded.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">The post list should be smart enough to preserve local changes after a refresh, doing away with the need for this dialog and the need to skip automatic refresh if there are local changes.</sentence>
