            <sentence id="1.2">To reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">- Have only a self-hosted blog in the app and be on the posts menu option.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">- Open the settings menu and sign in to a wpcom account.</sentence>

            <sentence id="1.7">Its selected but is blank and there is no topic selected.</sentence>
