    <title>Themes: View site probably shouldn't start a new task</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">If you view site from the Themes detail, it looks like a new task is started to show the view site tab.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">From this point a user can open the sidebar and choose a different option, posts for example.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">At this point the user has moved out of the themes feature but tapping the back softkey will dump them back into Themes instead of dismissing the app.</sentence>
