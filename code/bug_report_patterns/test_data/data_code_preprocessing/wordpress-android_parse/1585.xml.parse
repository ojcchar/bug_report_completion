        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">- ReaderTagActions.sanitizeTitle() should trim before replacing, to avoid replacing trailing/leading spaces with a dash</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">- ReaderSubsActivity.addAsTag() should trim the entry before comparing to followed tags</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">- The list of followed blogs appears to sort incorrectly when the blog name is empty (since it shows the domain in this situation)</sentence>
