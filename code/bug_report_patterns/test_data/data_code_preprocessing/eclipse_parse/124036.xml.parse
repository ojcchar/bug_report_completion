    <title>[j2ee facets] Need better facet descriptions</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">I think we shouldn't use the name of a facet as part of its definition unless we're unrolling an acronym (like EJB).</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Dynamic Web Module is one of the worst in this case: "Enables the project to be deployed as a dynamic web module."</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">From what I've found on Google, WTP is the only place using that term aside from some consulting firms.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">Can we instead describe the facets in a way that uses the corresponding J2EE/Web standards so that users new to WTP aren't left guessing?</sentence>
