            <sentence id="1.1">Since I first started using Eclipse 3.0 M7, to today using RC2, I've gotten a 
repeating error with Package Explorer.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">On exiting Eclipse I often get an error 
message "error saving some views", and then when I restart Eclipse Package 
Explorer comes up with no content except an error message "An error has 
occurred when creating this view".</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">The only work-around I've found is to 
delete Eclipse and reload it - irritating at the least.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">The only after-market 
plugin I'm using is MyEclipse.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">I don't know where the problem is or what 
causes it.</sentence>
