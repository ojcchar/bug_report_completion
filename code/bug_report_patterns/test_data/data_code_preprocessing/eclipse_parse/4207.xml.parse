    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Currently it is not possible to use one of the installed JREs when
	I want to use (i.e. specify on the build path) another JRE than the
	one specified by JRE_LIB for 	a specific project.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Also, it is not
	possible to create new classpath variables that point to/use one
	of the installed JREs: I have to enter the full path for ther library
	and the JAR.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">It would be nice if I would have to enter all my installed JREs only
	once.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">That's what I would expect from the Installed JREs preference
	page.</sentence>
