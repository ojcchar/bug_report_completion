    <title>Batch compiler - Classpath handling is too strict</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">If a classpath passed to the compiler contains an invalid entry, the compiler 
throws an exception.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">At worst, it should log a warning, but should proceed by 
ignoring invalid entries on the classpath.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">This is pretty much in line with 
what javac does.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">The code is in Main.java at line 602</sentence>
