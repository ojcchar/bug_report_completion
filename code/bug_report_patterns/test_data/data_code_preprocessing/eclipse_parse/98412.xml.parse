    <title>[launching] JARs from ${user.home}/.ant/lib not added to Ant classpath</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">My build file relies on JARs in ${user.home}/.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">ant/lib.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">But those JARs are not
loaded into Ant when I run it from within Eclipse.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.4">The normal Ant version loads JARs from ${user.home}/.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.5">ant/lib automatically.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.6">So
Eclipse behaves different from normal Ant.</sentence>
