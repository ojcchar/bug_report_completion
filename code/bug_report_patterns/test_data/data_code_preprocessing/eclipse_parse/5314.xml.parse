    <title>TVT1: Runtime instance of workbench ignores NL fragments</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">Once the NL fragments are installed, the workbench comes up in the desired 
language, as expected.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">However, when launching the run-time instance of the 
Workbench from the debugger (i.e., open PDE, select plugin.xml, select Debug 
button), the run-time instance comes up in English.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">It appears that the run-time (debug) instance of eclipse.exe ignores the 
presence of the fragments.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">Perhaps because it is in debug mode?</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">This problem 
was also reported via e-mail to John Wiegand.</sentence>
