    <title>updating firefox with setup will create multiple windows software entries</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">When updating Firefox with the .exe installer on Windows, it will create
multiple entries in the software panel, for example:
Mozilla Firefox (0.9.3)
Mozilla Firefox (1.0PR)</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">When updating via the zip file, there will still be an old entry (e.g. "Mozilla
Firefox (0.9.3)" when 1.0PR is installed) in the software list.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">This occurs also in Mozilla Thunderbird.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.2">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">1 Install an old version of Firefox or Thunderbird</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.4">2 Install a newer version</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Actual Results:  
Two entries were created in the software menu.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">Expected Results:</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.2">One of the following:</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.3">* Remove the old entry</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.4">* Create a non-version specific entry (e.g. "Mozilla Firefox" without version) so the entry gets overwritten automatically</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.5">* Automatically uninstall the old Mozilla Firefox version before installing the new one</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">A workaround is using the zip files to install Firefox (every time) or
uninstalling the old version before updating.</sentence>
