    <title>Firefox 3 no longer displays favicons (.ico image files) within browser windows/tabs</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Earlier versions of Firefox used to be able to display favicons which were used as image elements (IMG SRC) in web pages.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">They are sometimes used/useful as mini-icons for bullets in HTML lists.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">As of Firefox 3, when an IMG SRC attribute references a .ico file, it displays as a hollow rectangle image-placeholder rather than the favicon.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
