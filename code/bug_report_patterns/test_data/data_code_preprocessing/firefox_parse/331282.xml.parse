    <title>Wrong gecko version for bonecho 2.0a1</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The useragent string says Gecko 1.8, but that's incorrect since we have taken Gecko changes on the 1.8 branch.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">It should probably say "1.8.1a1" to reflect the fact that it is an alpha 1 version of what will become Gecko 1.8.1.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Also, the GeckoVer registry key is wrong:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mozilla\Bon Echo 2.0a1 [GeckoVer]
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Mozilla\Bon Echo 2.0a1 [GeckoVer]</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">These guys have a value of 1.7.5.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">We should try to make sure that these version numbers are corrected for 2.0a2.</sentence>
