    <title>bookmark sidebar scroll state is not (session) persistent</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Reopening the Bookmarks Sidebar after closing it returns you to top of Bookmarks
list, instead of to the folder you were last accessing.</sentence>

        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.2">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">1 Open the Bookmarks Sidebar.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.4">2 Open a folder at least one screen-height down the list.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.5">3 Click on a Bookmark in that folder.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.6">4 Close the Bookmarks Sidebar.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.7">5 Re-open the Bookmarks Sidebar.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Actual Results:  
You won't be where you were a moment ago -- you'll be back to the top each time.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">So you have to manually scroll down to access additional Bookmarks in the same
folder you started in.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Expected Results:  
Remember where were last time you had the Bookmarks Sidebar open.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">Which allows
you to access additional Bookmarks in the same folder without scrolling down to
find your spot each time.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">No/default theme installed.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.2">(I term this a Major Feature because I use and rely
on it constantly during my work day.)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">Great work in general, folks!</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">The tabs are a breath of fresh air.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.3">Thank you!</sentence>
