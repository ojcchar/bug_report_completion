    <title>Installer does not completely upgrade from 1.5.0.7</title>
    <description>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">I tried to install Firefox 2.0 RC3 over my existig installation and it did not completely upgrade.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">My extensions and settings were there, but it never checked for compatability (Sessionsaver did not work in 2.0 -- if I clicked "Resume Session" it created a tab called "Undefined" that could not be closed without restarting the browser, and my session was not restored).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">Also it did not import my bookmarks.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">(Luckily everything is back to normal now that I reinstalled 1.5.0.7.)</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">1 Have FF 1.5.0.7 open, download FF2.0 RC3 installer</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.3">2 Run installer, let it close FF</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.4">3 Start Firefox 2.0 RC3</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">Actual Results:  
The installer didn't even acknowledge that I had 1.5.0.7.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">It just told me to quit Firefox then continued installing.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="6">
            <sentence id="6.1">Expected Results:  
It should ask if you want to clean install or upgrade.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="7">
            <sentence id="7.1">Maybe the automatic update when 2.0 is released will work properly (is there somewhere I can get that?)</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">, but what about users that want to test it before it is released?</sentence>
