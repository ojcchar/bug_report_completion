            <sentence id="2.1">The behavior seems to have become worse a few weeks ago.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">If I click on a link (or open a bookmark, or allow SessionSaver to restore a link, etc.) and it does not resolve (Correctly? In time? ???), the throbber and the spinner on the tab continue to spin forever. </sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">(What used to happen was the link was unavailable until you reloaded the page.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">However, all other links worked normally.)</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.5">If you click another link, or hit STOP, or hit RELOAD, you are hosed becaue no other link will work until you restart the browser.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.6">All menus work and respond normally.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.7">If you click on the "Red X" to close Firebird, the window closes immediately.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.8">However, if you attempt to restart Firebird, you get an error that someone is already using your profile.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.9">You must use Task Manager to kill the zombie Mozilla thread.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.10">Now you can restart Firebird.</sentence>

            <sentence id="3.1">I am using a P4 with HyperThreading turned on.</sentence>

an entry in a thread on Mozillazine where someone suggested the zombie thread

            <sentence id="5.1">Steps to Reproduce:</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">There is no known reliable way to reproduce the problem.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.3">It *seems* to be related to network load.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.4">The behavior is as if a link is unable to resolve or load correctly (or in time).</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.5">However, this exact same link and page will load correctly most of the time.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.6">Very frustrating.</sentence>

            <sentence id="6.2">When the bug does happen, the throbber and tab spinner continue to animate forever.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.3">Clicking on any link, selecting a bookmark, clicking on STOP or RELOAD, does nothing to resolve the problem.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.4">No matter what you do (even if you have multiple Firebird windows open) will allow you to browse to any other page.</sentence>
            <sentence id="6.5">You must close Firebird and then kill the zombie thread before you can restart Firebird.</sentence>
        </paragraph>

            <sentence id="7.1">Expected Results:  
If a link cannot be resolved correct, an error should be generated.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.2">If a link cannot be resolved in time, an error should be generated.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.3">Regardless of cause, the user should be able to click on any other link, select
a bookmard, or RELOAD the page successfully.</sentence>
            <sentence id="7.4">When Firebird is closed, there
should be no remaining zombie threads.</sentence>

Firebird.</sentence>
