    <description>
        <paragraph id="1">
            <sentence id="1.1">The .shtml handler did not include a default value (e.g. shtmlfile) for its reg key.</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.2">Also, Firefox can only be registered as the default browser by launching it and making it default or through "Set program access and defaults" initially due to it not being displayed in "Set your default programs".</sentence>
            <sentence id="1.3">After setting it as default it is displayed in "Set your default programs".</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">We should verify that all of the protocol and file handlers we register as potential defaults for Firefox have all of the required information due to .shtml in Vista RC1 and gopher not being present at all in Vista Beta 2.</sentence>
