            <sentence id="2.2">This tool seems to inject some code into every application running in the windows XP session.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.3">With this tool loaded, firefox crashes when displaying attached file demo_crash.htm and clicking the link on top of the page many times (5-7 times).</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.4">The attached file demo_works.htm is almost the same but only one line of data in the table; is will not crash the browser.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">I cannot find something wrong in the page.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">even the html validator http://validator.w3.org/ says it is ok.</sentence>
