    <description>
        <paragraph id="2">
            <sentence id="2.1">Some compatible extensions get magically "not compatible" from time to time.</sentence>
            <sentence id="2.2">When this happens, it's enough to click the "Find updates" button in the Add-ons dialog, and they magically (again) start working.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="3">
            <sentence id="3.1">Later on, they get not compatible again.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.2">This happens when restarting Firefox or the OS, but now always.</sentence>
            <sentence id="3.3">It doesn't depend on updates to Firefox nor to any other extension.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="4">
            <sentence id="4.1">This has been a long time issue for me, specially with the Brazilian Portuguese dictionary.</sentence>
            <sentence id="4.2">It happens now with another extension (URL Alias), so I've understood it's an overall Firefox issue.</sentence>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph id="5">
            <sentence id="5.1">I'll attach some screenshots of the issue.</sentence>
            <sentence id="5.2">It always happens with both extensions at the same time; never for one of them only.</sentence>
