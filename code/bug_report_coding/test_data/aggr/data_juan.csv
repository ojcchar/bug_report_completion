eclipse;157933;1;"- I work on task FOO (let's say I implement a
  feature)

- Now I see something in the code that I think
  should be refactored (not directly related to
  FOO), but because I am working on FOO, I create
  a new task FIXME to remind me to do this.

- If I now switch to the newly created task FIXME,
  all my editors get closed. This makes sense if
  I switch to a task that has context, because
  mylar puts me in that context. But FIXME is
  a newly created task without context and I have
  to start building the context starting from zero.
  All my editors get closed and the expanded tree
  in the package explorer gets collapsed.

- This is annoying, because I have now to navigate
  back to the file I have found the problem that
  made me creating the new task FIXME.

- However. If I work with no task active, and I
  find something interesting and create a task
  FIXME, then I can activate FIXME a all my editors
  remain open. But working on no task is also annoying,
  because if I work on a task and I deactivate the
  task: BANG all my editors get closed.";;;;x;P_SR_ACTIONS_PRESENT;;;;
eclipse;157933;2;"Possible solutions:
1) When switching off a task (going into normal
   mode), don't clear the context. Have an action
   clean everything when no task is active. This
   could be done in the active task context menu:
   ""Deactivate without closing editors"". I could
   close the stuff I don't want, before I activate
   my new empty Task.

2) Have a button deactivate the current task
   without closing all editors. This could be
   done by a stop button in the task list. The
   only difference is that it deactivates the
   current task and does not close the open
   editors and the expanded items in the package
   explorer. Again, now I could close the stuff
   I don't want, before I activate my new empty Task.

2) Switching to tasks without context never cleans
   the context (like it does if you have no task
   active)

3) Copy the context from the old task to the new
   task.";;;x;;P_EB_POSSIBLE_SOLUTIONS;;;;
